Janet Anderson is the author of this chapter.

## Overview

This chapter describes the EPICS build facility including directory
structure, environment and system requirements, configuration files,
Makefiles, and related build tools.

### `<top>` Directory structure

EPICS software can be divided into multiple `<top>` areas. Examples of
`<top>` areas are EPICS base itself, EPICS extensions, and simple or
complicated IOC applications. Each `<top>` may be maintained separately.
Different `<top>` areas can be on different releases of external
software such as EPICS base releases.

A `<top>` directory has the following directory structure:

```
<top>/
├── Makefile
├── configure/
├── dir1/
├── dir2/
├── ...
```

where `configure` is a directory containing build configuration files and
a `Makefile`, where `dir1, dir2,` ... are user created subdirectory trees
with Makefiles and source files to be built. Because the build rules
allow make commands like `make install.vxWorks-68040`, subdirectory
names within a `<top>` directory structure may not contain a period
"." character.

### Install Directories

Files generated during the build are installed into subdirectories of an
installation directory which defaults to `$(TOP)`, the `<top>` directory.
For base, extensions, and IOC applications, the default value can be
changed in the `configure/CONFIG_SITE` file. The installation directory
for the EPICS components is controlled by the definition of the
`INSTALL_LOCATION` variable.

Due to a side-effect of the build rules, the *parent* of the installation directory `($(INSTALL_LOCATION)/..)` 
should not contain directories with the same names as the subdirectories listed below.


The following subdirectories may exist in the installation directory.
They are created by the build and contain the installed build
components.

-   `dbd` - Directory into which Database Definition files are installed.
-   `include` - The directory into which C header files are installed.
    These header files may be generated from menu and record type
    definitions.
-   `bin` - This directory contains a subdirectory for each host
    architecture and for each target architecture. These are the
    directories into which executables, binaries, etc. are installed.
-   `lib` - This directory contains a subdirectory for each host
    architecture. These are the directories into which libraries are
    installed.
-   `db` - This is the directory into which database record instance,
    template, and substitution files are installed.
-   `html` - This is the directory into which html documentation is
    installed.
-   `templates` - This is the directory into which template files are
    installed.
-   `javalib` - This is the directory into which java class files and jar
    files are installed.
-   `configure` - The directory into which configure files are installed
    (if `INSTALL_LOCATION` does not equal `TOP`).
-   `cfg` - The directory into which user created configure files are
    installed

### Elements of build system

The main ingredients of the build system are:

-   A set of configuration files and tools provided in the EPICS
    `base/configure` directory
-   A corresponding set of configuration files in the
    `<top>/configure` directory of a non-base
    `<top>` directory structure to be built. The
    `makeBaseApp.pl` and `makeBaseExt.pl`
    scripts create these configuration files. Many of these files just
    include a file of the same name from the `base/configure` directory.
-   Makefiles in each directory of the `<top>` directory structure to be
    built
-   User created configuration files in build created
    `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/cfg` directories.

### Features

The principal features of the build system are:

-   Requires a single `Makefile` in each directory of a `<top>` directory
    structure
-   Supports both host os vendor's native compiler and GNU compiler
-   Supports building multiple types of software (libraries,
    executables, databases, java class files, etc.) stored in a single
    directory tree.
-   Supports building EPICS base, extensions, and IOC applications.
-   Supports multiple host and target operating system + architecture
    combinations.
-   Allows builds for all hosts and targets within a single `<top>`
    source directory tree.
-   Allows sharing of components such as special record/device/drivers
    across `<top>` areas.
-   gnumake is the only command used to build a `<top>` area.

### Multiple host and target systems

You can build on multiple host systems and for multiple cross target
systems using a single EPICS directory structure. The intermediate and
binary files generated by the build will be created in separate
`O.*` subdirectories and installed into the appropriate
separate host or target install directories. EPICS executables and
scripts are installed into the
`$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/bin/<arch>` directories. Libraries
are installed into `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/lib/<arch>`. The
default definition for `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)` is
`$(TOP)` which is the root directory in the directory
structure. Architecture dependant created files (e.g. object files) are
stored in `O.<arch>` source subdirectories, and
architecture independent created files are stored in
`O.Common` source subdirectories. This allows objects for
multiple cross target architectures to be maintained at the same time.

To build EPICS base for a specific host/target combination you must have
the proper host/target c/c++ cross compiler and target header files,
`CROSS_COMPILER_HOST_ARCHS` must empty or include the host
architecture in its list value, the
`CROSS_COMPILER_TARGET_ARCHS` variable must include the
target to be cross-compiled, and the base/configure/ os directory must
have the appropriate configure files.

## Build Requirements

### Host Environment Variable

Only one environment variable, `EPICS_HOST_ARCH`, is
required to build EPICS `<top>` areas. This variable should be set to be
your workstation's operating system - architecture combination to use
the os vendor's c/c++ compiler for native builds or set to the
operating system - architecture - alternate compiler combination to use
an alternate compiler for native builds if an alternate compiler is
supported on your system. The filenames of the `CONFIG.*.Common` files in
base/ configure/os show the currently supported
`EPICS_HOST_ARCH` values. Examples are solaris-sparc,
solaris-sparc-gnu, linux-x86, win32-x86, and cygwin-x86.

### Software Prerequisites

Before you can build EPICS components your host system must have the
following software installed:

-   Perl version 5.8 or greater
-   GNU make, version 3.81 or greater
-   C++ compiler (host operating system vendor's compiler or GNU
    compiler)

If you will be building EPICS components for vxWorks targets you will
also need:

-   Tornado II or vxWorks 6.x or later, and one or more board support
    packages. Consult the vxWorks documentation for details.

If you will be building EPICS components for RTEMS targets you will also
need:

-   RTEMS development tools and libraries required to run EPICS IOC
    applications.

### Path requirements

You must have the perl executable in your path and you may need C and
C++ compilers in your search path. Check definitions of `CC` and `CCC` in
`base/configure/os/CONFIG.<host>.<host>` or the definitions for GCC
and G++ if `ANSI=GCC` and `CPLUSPLUS=GCC` are specified in
`CONFIG_SITE`. For building base you also must have echo in
your search path. You can override the default settings by defining
`PERL`, `CC` and `CCC`, `GCC` and `G++`, `GNU_DIR` ... in the appropriate file
(usually `configure/os/CONFIG_SITE.$EPICS_HOST_ARCH.Common`)

#### Unix path

For Unix host builds you also need `touch`, `cpp`, `cp`, `rm`, `mv`, and `mkdir` in
your search path and `/bin/chmod` must exist. On some Unix systems you may
also need `ar` and `ranlib` in your path, and the c compiler may require `ld`
in your path.

#### Win32 PATH

On WIN32 systems, building shared libraries is the default setting and
you will need to add fullpathname to
`$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/bin/$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH)` to your path so the shared
libraries, dll's, can be found during the build.. Building shared
libraries is determined by the value of the macro
`SHARED_LIBRARIES` in `CONFIG_SITE` or
`os/CONFIG.Common.<host>` (either `YES` or `NO`).

### Directory names

Because the build rules allow make commands like
`make <dir>.<action>,<arch>`, subdirectory names within a `<top>`
directory structure may not contain a period "." character.

### `EPICS_HOST_ARCH` environment variable

The startup directory in EPICS base contains a perl script,
`EpicsHostArch.pl`, which can be used to define
`EPICS_HOST_ARCH`. This script can be invoked with a command
line parameter defining the alternate compiler (e.g. if invoking
`EpicsHostArch.pl` yields `solaris-sparc`, then invoking `EpicsHostArch.pl
gnu` will yield `solaris-sparc-gnu`).

The startup directory also contains scripts to help users set the path
and other environment variables.

## Configuration Definitions

### Site-specific EPICS Base Configuration

#### Site configuration

To configure EPICS base for your site, you may want to modify the
default definitions in the following files:

* `configure/CONFIG_SITE` - Build choices. Specify target archs.
* `configure/CONFIG_SITE_ENV` - Environment variable defaults

#### Host configuration

To configure each host system for your site, you may override the
default definitions in the `configure/os` directory by adding a new file
with override definitions. The new file should have the same name as the
distribution file to be overridden except `CONFIG` in the name is changed
to `CONFIG_SITE`.

* `configure/os/CONFIG_SITE.<host>.<host>` - Host build settings
* `configure/os/CONFIG_SITE.<host>.Common` - Host build settings for
  all target systems

#### Target configuration

To configure each target system, you may override the default
definitions in the `configure/os` directory by adding a new file with
override definitions. The new file should have the same name as the
distribution file to be overridden except `CONFIG` in the name is replaced
by `CONFIG_SITE`.

* `configure/os/CONFIG_SITE.Common.<target>` - Target cross settings
* `configure/os/CONFIG_SITE.<host>.<target>` - Host-target settings
* `configure/os/CONFIG_SITE.Common.vxWorksCommon` - vxWorks full paths

#### R3.13 compatibility configuration

To configure EPICS base for building with R3.13 extensions and ioc
applications, you must modify the default definitions in the
`base/config/CONFIG_SITE*` files to agree with site
definitions you made in base/configure and base/configure/os files.You
must also modify the following tow macros in the
`base/configure/CONFIG_SITE` file:

* `COMPAT_TOOLS_313` - Set to `YES` to build R3.13 extensions with this base.
* `COMPAT_313` - Set to `YES` to build R3.13 ioc applications and extensions with
  this base.

### Directory definitions

The configure files contain definitions for locations in which to
install various components. These are all relative to
`INSTALL_LOCATION`. The default value for
`INSTALL_LOCATION` is `$(TOP)`, and `$(T_A)` is the current
build's target architecture. The default value for
`INSTALL_LOCATION` can be overridden in the
`configure/CONFIG_SITE` file.

```makefile
INSTALL_LOCATION_LIB = $(INSTALL_LOCATION)/lib
INSTALL_LOCATION_BIN = $(INSTALL_LOCATION)/bin

INSTALL_HOST_BIN = $(INSTALL_LOCATION_BIN)/$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH)
INSTALL_HOST_LIB = $(INSTALL_LOCATION_LIB)/$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH)

INSTALL_INCLUDE = $(INSTALL_LOCATION)/include
INSTALL_DOC = $(INSTALL_LOCATION)/doc
INSTALL_HTML = $(INSTALL_LOCATION)/html
INSTALL_TEMPLATES = $(INSTALL_LOCATION)/templates
INSTALL_DBD = $(INSTALL_LOCATION)/dbd
INSTALL_DB = $(INSTALL_LOCATION)/db
INSTALL_CONFIG = $(INSTALL_LOCATION)/configure
INSTALL_JAVA = $(INSTALL_LOCATION)/javalib

INSTALL_LIB = $(INSTALL_LOCATION_LIB)/$(T_A)
INSTALL_SHRLIB = $(INSTALL_LOCATION_LIB)/$(T_A)
INSTALL_TCLLIB = $(INSTALL_LOCATION_LIB)/$(T_A)
INSTALL_BIN = $(INSTALL_LOCATION_BIN)/$(T_A)
```

### Extension and Application Specific Configuration

The `base/configure` directory contains files with the default build definitions
and site specific build definitions. The `extensions/configure` directory contains
extension specific build definitions (e.g. location of X11 and Motif libraries)
and `"include <filename>"` lines for the base/configure files. Likewise, the
`<application>/configure` directory contains application specific build
definitions and includes for the application source files. Build definitions
such as `CROSS_COMPILER_TARGET_ARCHS` can be overridden in an extension or
application by placing an override definition in the
`<top>/configure/CONFIG_SITE` file.

### RELEASE file

Every `<top>/configure` directory contains a `RELEASE` file. `RELEASE`
contains a user specified list of other `<top>` directory structures
containing files needed by the current `<top>`, and may also include
other files to take those definitions from elsewhere. The macros defined
in the `RELEASE` file (or its includes) may reference other defined
macros, but cannot rely on environment variables to provide definitions.

When make is executed, macro definitions for include, bin, and library
directories are automatically generated for each external `<top>`
definition given in the `RELEASE` file. Also generated are include
statements for any existing `RULES_BUILD` files, `cfg/RULES*`
files, and `cfg/CONFIG*` files from each external `<top>` listed in the
`RELEASE` file.

For example, if `configure/RELEASE` contains the definition

```
CAMAC = /home/epics/modules/bus/camac
```

then the generated macros will be:

```makefile
CAMAC_HOST_BIN = /home/epics/modules/bus/camac/bin/$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH)
CAMAC_HOST_LIB = /home/epics/modules/bus/camac/lib/$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH)
CAMAC_BIN = /home/epics/modules/bus/camac/bin/$(T_A)
CAMAC_LIB = /home/epics/modules/bus/camac/lib/$(T_A)
RELEASE_INCLUDES += -I/home/epics/modules/bus/camac/include/os
RELEASE_INCLUDES += -I/home/epics/modules/bus/camac/include
RELEASE_DBDFLAGS += -I /home/epics/modules/bus/camac/dbd
RELEASE_DBFLAGS += -I/home/epics/modules/bus/camac/db
RELEASE_PERL_MODULE_DIRS += /home/epics/modules/bus/camac/lib/perl
```

`RELEASE_DBDFLAGS` will appear on the command lines for the
`dbToRecordTypeH`, `mkmf.pl`, and `dbExpand` tools, and
`RELEASE_INCLUDES` will appear on compiler command lines.
`CAMAC_LIB` and `CAMAC_BIN` can be used in a
Makefile to define the location of needed scripts, executables, object
files, libraries or other files.

Definitions in `configure/RELEASE` can be overridden for a specific host
and target architectures by providing the appropriate file or files
containing overriding definitions.

```
configure/RELEASE.<epics_host_arch>.Common
configure/RELEASE.Common.<targetarch>
configure/RELEASE.<epics_host_arch>.<targetarch>
```

For `<top>` directory structures created by `makeBaseApp.pl`, an EPICS
base perl script, `convertRelease.pl` can perform consistency checks for
the external `<top>` definitions in the `RELEASE` file and its includes as
part of the `<top>` level build. Consistancy checks are controlled by
value of `CHECK_RELEASE` which is defined in
`<top>/configure/CONFIG_SITE`. `CHECK_RELEASE` can be set
to `YES`, `NO` or `WARN`, and if `YES` (the default value), consistency checks
will be performed. If `CHECK_RELEASE` is set to `WARN` the
build will continue even if conflicts are found.

### Modifying `configure/RELEASE*` files

You should always do a `gnumake clean uninstall` in the `<top>` directory
BEFORE adding, changing, or removing any definitions in the
`configure/RELEASE*` files and then a gnumake at the top level AFTER
making the changes.

The file `<top>/configure/RELEASE` contains definitions for components
obtained from outside `<top>`. If you want to link to a new release of
anything defined in the file do the following:

```console
$ cd <top>
$ make clean uninstall
```
edit `configure/RELEASE`, and change the relevant line(s) to point to the new
release

```console
$ make
```

All definitions in `<top>/configure/RELEASE` must result in complete
path definitions, i.e. relative path names are not permitted. If your
site could have multiple releases of base and other support `<top>`
components installed at once, these path definitions should contain a
release number as one of the components. However as the `RELEASE` file is
read by gnumake, it is permissible to use macro substitutions to define
these pathnames, for example:

```makefile
SUPPORT = /usr/local/iocapps/R3.14.9
EPICS_BASE = $(SUPPORT)/base/3-14-9-asd1
```

### OS Class specific definitions

Definitions in a Makefile will apply to the host system (the platform on
which make is executed) and each system defined by
`CROSS_COMPILER_TARGET_ARCHS`.

It is possible to limit the architectures for which a particular
definition is used. Most Makefile definition names can be specified with
an appended underscore "_" followed by an osclass name. If an
`_<osclass>` is not specified, then the definition applies to the host
and all `CROSS_COMPILER_TARGET_ARCHS` systems. If an
`_<osclass>` is specified, then the definition applies only to systems
with the specified os class. A Makefile definition can also have an
appended `_DEFAULT` specification. If `_DEFAULT` is appended, then the
Makefile definition will apply to all systems that do not have an
`_<osclass>` specification for that definition. If a `_DEFAULT`
definition exists but should not apply to a particular system OS Class,
the value `-nil-` should be specified in the relevant Makefile
definition.

Each system has an `OS_CLASS` definition in its
`configure/os/CONFIG.Common.<arch>` file. A few examples are:

* For vxWorks-* targets `OS_CLASS` is `vxWorks`.
* For RTEMS-* targets `OS_CLASS` is `RTEMS`.
* For solaris-* targets `OS_CLASS` is `solaris`.
* For win32-* targets `OS_CLASS` is `WIN32`.
* For linux-* targets `OS_CLASS` is `Linux`.
* For darwin-* targets `OS_CLASS` is `Darwin`.
* For aix-* targets `OS_CLASS` is `AIX`.

For example the following Makefile lines specify that product aaa should
be created for all systems. Product bbb should be created for systems
that do not have `OS_CLASS` defined as solaris.

```makefile
PROD = aaa
PROD_solaris = -nil-
PROD_DEFAULT = bbb
```

### Specifying `T_A` specific definitions

It is possible for the user to limit the systems for which a particular
definition applies to specific target systems.

For example the following Makefile lines specify that product aaa should
be created for all target architecture which allow IOC type products and
product bbb should be created only for the vxWorks-68040 and
vxWorks-ppc603 targets. Remember `T_A` is the build's
current target architecture. so `PROD_IOC` has the bbb value
only when the current built target architecture is vwWorks-68040 or
vxWorks-ppc603

```makefile
PROD_IOC = aaa
VX_PROD_vxWorks-68040 = bbb
VX_PROD_vxWorks-ppc603 = bbb
PROD_IOC += VX_PROD_$(T_A)
```

### Host and Ioc targets

Build creates two type of makefile targets: Host and Ioc. Host targets
are executables, object files, libraries, and scripts which are not part
of iocCore. Ioc targets are components of ioc libraries, executables,
object files, or iocsh scripts which will be run on an ioc.

Each supported target system has a `VALID_BUILDS` definition
which specifies the type of makefile targets it can support. This
definition appears in `configure/os/CONFIG.Common.<arch>` or
`configure/os/CONFIG.<arch>.<arch>` files.

* For vxWorks systems `VALID_BUILDS` is set to "Ioc".
* For Unix type systems, `VALID_BUILDS` is set to "Host Ioc".
* For RTEMS systems, `VALID_BUILDS` is set to "Ioc".
* For WIN32 systems, `VALID_BUILDS` is set to "Host Ioc".

In a Makefile it is possible to limit the systems for which a particular
`PROD`, `TESTPROD`, `LIBRARY`, `SCRIPTS`, and `OBJS` is built. For example the
following Makefile lines specify that product aaa should be created for
systems that support Host type builds. Product bbb should be created for
systems that support Ioc type builds. Product ccc should be created for
all target systems.

```makefile
PROD_HOST = aaa
PROD_IOC = bbb
PROD = ccc
```

These definitions can be further limited by specifying an appended
underscore "_" followed by an osclass or `DEFAULT` specification.

### User specific override definitions

User specific override definitions are allowed in user created files in
the user's `<home>/configure` subdirectory. These override definitions
will be used for builds in all `<top>` directory structures. The files
must have the following names.

```
<home>/configure/CONFIG_USER
<home>/configure/CONFIG_USER.<epics_host_arch>
<home>/configure/CONFIG_USER.Common.<targetarch>
<home>/configure/CONFIG_USER.<epics_host_arch>.<targetarch>
```

## Makefiles

### Name

The name of the makefile in each directory must be Makefile.

### Included Files

Makefiles normally include files from `<top>/configure`. Thus the
makefile "inherits" rules and definitions from configure. The files in
`<top>/configure` may in turn include files from another
`<top>/configure`. This technique makes it possible to share make
variables and even rules across `<top>` directories.

### Contents of Makefiles

#### Makefiles in directories containing subdirectories

A Makefile in this type of directory must define where `<top>` is
relative to this directory, include `<top>/configure` files, and specify
the subdirectories in the desired order of make execution. Running
gnumake in a directory with the following Makefile lines will cause
gnumake to be executed in `<dir1>` first and then `<dir2>`. The build
rules do not allow a Makefile to specify both subdirectories and
components to be built.

```makefile
TOP=../..
include $(TOP)/configure/CONFIG
DIRS += <dir1> <dir2>
include $(TOP)/configure/RULES_DIRS
```

#### Makefiles in directories where components are to be built

A Makefile in this type of directory must define where `<top>` is
relative to this directory, include `<top>` configure files, and specify
the target component definitions. Optionally it may contain user defined
rules. Running gnumake in a directory with this type of Makefile will
cause gnumake to create an `O.<arch>` subdirectory and then execute
gnumake to build the defined components in this subdirectory. It
contains the following lines:

```makefile
TOP=../../..
include $(TOP)/configure/CONFIG
# <component definition lines>
include $(TOP)/configure/RULES
# <optional rules definitions>
```

### Simple Makefile examples

Create an IOC type library named asIoc from the source file `asDbLib.c`
and install it into the `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/lib/<arch>` directory.

```makefile
TOP=../../..
include $(TOP)/configure/CONFIG
LIBRARY_IOC += asIoc
asIoc_SRCS += asDbLib.c
include $(TOP)/configure/RULES
```

For each Host type target architecture, create an executable named
catest from the `catest1.c` and `catest2.c` source files linking with the
existing EPICS base ca and Com libraries, and then install the catest
executable into the `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/bin/<arch>` directory.

```makefile
TOP=../../..
include $(TOP)/configure/CONFIG
PROD_HOST = catest
catest_SRCS += catest1.c catest2.c
catest_LIBS = ca Com
include $(TOP)/configure/RULES
```

## Make

### Make vs. gnumake

EPICS provides an extensive set of make rules. These rules only work
with the GNU version of make, gnumake, which is supplied by the Free
Software Foundation. Thus, on most Unix systems, the native make will
not work. On some systems, e.g. Linux, GNU make may be the default. This
manual always uses gnumake in the examples.

### Frequently used Make commands

```{admonition} NOTE
It is possible to invoke the following commands for a single
target architecture by appending `<arch>` to the target in the command.
```

The most frequently used make commands are:

gnumake

:   This rebuilds and installs everything that is not up to date.

    ```{admonition} NOTE
    Executing gnumake without arguments is the same as `gnumake install`
    ```

gnumake help

:   This command can be executed from the `<top>` directory only. This
    command prints a page describing the most frequently used make
    commands.

gnumake install

:   This rebuilds and installs everything that is not up to date.

gnumake all

:   This is the same as `gnumake install`.

gnumake buildInstall

:   This is the same as `gnumake install`.

gnumake<arch>

:   This rebuilds and installs everything that is not up to date first
    for the host arch and then (if different) for the specified target
    arch.

    ```{admonition} NOTE
    This is the same as `gnumake install.<arch>`
    ```


gnumake clean

:   This can be used to save disk space by deleting the `O.<arch>`
    directories that gnumake will create, but does not remove any installed
    files from the bin, db, dbd etc. directories. `gnumake clean.<arch>`
    can be invoked to clean a single architecture.

gnumake archclean

:   This command will remove the current build's `O.<arch>` directories
    but not `O.Common` directory.

gnumake realclean

:   This command will remove ALL the `O.<arch>` subdirectories (even
    those created by a gnumake from another
    `EPICS_HOST_ARCH`).

gnumake rebuild

:   This is the same as `gnumake clean install`. If you are unsure
    about the state of the generated files in an application, just
    execute `gnumake rebuild`.

gnumake uninstall

:   This command can be executed from the `<top>` directory only. It
    will remove everything installed by gnumake in the include, lib,
    bin, db, dbd, etc. directories.

gnumake realuninstall

:   This command can be executed from the `<top>` directory only. It
    will remove all the install directories, include, lib, bin, db, dbd,
    etc.

gnumake distclean

:   This command can be executed from the `<top>` directory only. It is
    the same as issuing both the realclean and realuninstall commands.

gnumake cvsclean

:   This command can be executed from the `<top>` directory only. It
    removes cvs .#* files in the make directory tree.

### Make targets

The following is a summary of targets that can be specified for gnumake:

* `<action>`
* `<arch>`
* `<action>.<arch>`
* `<dir>`
* `<dir>.<action>`
* `<dir>.<arch>`
* `<dir>.<action>.<arch>`

where:

* `<action>` is help, clean, realclean, distclean, inc, install, build, rebuild,
  buildInstall, realuninstall, or uninstall
* `<arch>` is an architecture such as solaris-sparc, vxWorks-68040, win32-x86,
  etc.
* `<dir>` is a path in module directory.

```{admonition} NOTE
help, uninstall, distclean, cvsclean, and realuninstall can only
be specified at `<top>`.

realclean cannot be specified inside an `O.<arch>` subdirectory.
`<dir>` is subdirectory name
```

```{admonition} NOTE
You can build using your os vendor's native compiler and also
build using a supported alternate compiler in the same directory
structure because the executables and libraries will be created and
installed into separate directories (e.g bin/solaris-sparc and
bin/solaris-sparc-gnu). You can do this by changing your
`EPICS_HOST_ARCH`, environment variable between builds or by setting
`EPICS_HOST_ARCH` on the gnumake command line.
```

The build system ensures the host architecture is up to date before
building a cross-compiled target, thus Makefiles must be explicit in
defining which architectures a component should be built for.

### Header file dependencies

All product, test product, and library source files which appear in one
of the source file definitions (e.g. `SRCS`, `PROD_SRCS`,
`LIB_SRCS`, `<prodname>_SRCS`) will have their header file
dependencies automatically generated and included as part of the
Makefile.

## Makefile definitions

The following components can be defined in a Makefile:

### Source file directories

Normally all product, test product, and library source files reside in
the same directory as the Makefile. OS specific source files are allowed
and should reside in subdirectories `os/<os_class>` or `os/posix` or
`os/default`.

The build rules also allow source files to reside in subdirectories of
the current Makefile directory (src directory). For each subdirectory
`<dir>` containing source files add the `SRC_DIRS`
definition.

```
SRC_DIRS += <dir>
```

where `<dir>` is a relative path definition. An example of
`SRC_DIRS` is

```
SRC_DIRS += ../dir1 ../dir2
```

The directory search order for the above definition is

```
. 
../os/$(OS_CLASS) ../os/posix ../os/default ../dir1/os/$(OS_CLASS)
../dir1/os/posix ../dir1/os/default ../dir2/os/$(OS_CLASS)
../dir2/os/posix ../dir2/os/default .. ../dir1 ../dir2
```

where the build directory `O.<arch>` is `.` and the `src` directory is `..` .

### Posix C source code

The epics base config files assume posix source code and define POSIX to
be `YES` as the default. Individual Makefiles can override this by setting
POSIX to `NO`. Source code files may have the suffix .c, .cc, .cpp, or .C.

### Breakpoint Tables

For each breakpoint table dbd file, `bpt<table name>.dbd`, to be created
from an existing `bpt<table name>.data` file, add the definition

```
DBD += bpt<table name>.dbd
```

to the Makefile. The following Makefile will create a `bptTypeJdegC.dbd`
file from an existing `bptTypeJdegC.data` file using the EPICS base
utility program makeBpt and install the new dbd file into the
`$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/dbd` directory.

```makefile
TOP=../../..
include $(TOP)/configure/CONFIG
DBD += bptTypeJdegC.dbd
include $(TOP)/configure/RULES
```

### Record Type Definitions

For each new record type, the following definition should be added to
the makefile:

```
DBDINC += <rectype>Record
```

A `<rectype>Record.h` header file will be created from an existing
`<rectype>Record.dbd` file using the EPICS base utility program
dbToRecordTypeH. This header will be installed into the
`$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/include` directory and the dbd file will be
installed into the `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/dbd` directory.

The following Makefile will create `xxxRecord.h` from an existing
`xxxRecord.dbd` file, install `xxxRecord.h` into
`$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/include`, and install `xxxRecord.dbd` into
`$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/dbd`.

```makefile
TOP=../../..
include $(TOP)/configure/CONFIG
DBDINC += xxxRecord
include $(TOP)/configure/RULES
```

### Menus

If a menu `menu<name>.dbd` file is present, then add the following
definition:

```
DBDINC += menu<name>.h
```

The header file, `menu<name>.h` will be created from the existing
`menu<name>.dbd` file using the EPICS base utility program `dbToMenuH` and
installed into the `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/include` directory and the menu
dbd file will be installed into `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/dbd`.

The following Makefile will create a `menuConvert.h` file from an existing
`menuConvert.dbd` file and install `menuConvert.h` into
`$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/include` and `menuConvert.dbd` into
`$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/dbd`.

```makefile
TOP=../../..
include $(TOP)/configure/CONFIG
DBDINC = menuConvert.h
include $(TOP)/configure/RULES
```

### Expanded Database Definition Files

Database definition include files named `<name>Include.dbd` containing
includes for other database definition files can be expanded by the
EPICS base utility program dbExpand into a created `<name>.dbd` file and
the `<name>.dbd` file installed into `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/dbd`. The
following variables control the process:

```
DBD += <name>.dbd
USR_DBDFLAGS += -I <include path>
USR_DBDFLAGS += -S <macro substitutions>
<name>_DBD += <file1>.dbd <file2>.dbd ...
```

where

```
DBD += <name>.dbd
```

is the name of the output dbd file to contain the expanded definitions.
It is created by expanding an existing or build created
`<name>Include.dbd` file and then copied into `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/dbd`.

An example of a file to be expanded is `exampleInclude.dbd` containing the
following lines

```
include "base.dbd"
include "xxxRecord.dbd"
device(xxx,CONSTANT,devXxxSoft,"SoftChannel")
```

`USR_DBDFLAGS` defines optional flags for dbExpand.
Currently only an include path (`-I <path>`) and macro substitution
(`-S <substitution>`) are supported. The include paths for EPICS `base/dbd`,
and other `<top>/dbd` directories will automatically be added during the
build if the `<top>` names are specified in the `configure/RELEASE` file.

A database definition include file named `<name>Include.dbd` containing
includes for other database definition files can be created from a
`<name>_DBD` definition. The lines

```
DBD += <name>.dbd
<name>_DBD += <file1>.dbd <file2>.dbd ...
```

will create an expanded dbd file `<name>.dbd` by first creating a
`<name>Include.dbd`. For each filename in the `<name>_DBD` definition,
the created `<name>Include.dbd` will contain an include statement for
that filename. Then the expanded DBD file is generated from the created
`<name>Include.dbd` file and installed into `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/dbd`.

The following Makefile will create an expanded dbd file named
example.dbd from an existing `exampleInclude.dbd` file and then install
example.dbd into the `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/dbd` directory.

```makefile
TOP=../../..
include $(TOP)/configure/CONFIG
DBD += exampleApp.dbd
include $(TOP)/configure/RULES
```

The following Makefile will create an `exampleInclude.dbd` file from the
`example_DBD` definition then expand it to create an expanded dbd file,
`example.dbd`, and install `example.dbd` into the `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/dbd`
directory.

```makefile
TOP=../../..
include $(TOP)/configure/CONFIG
DBD += example.dbd
example_DBD += base.dbd xxxRecord.dbd xxxSupport.dbd
include $(TOP)/configure/RULES
```

The created `exampleInclude.dbd` file will contain the following lines

```
include "base.dbd"
include "xxxRecord.dbd"
include "xxxSupport.dbd"
```

### Registering Support Routines for Expanded Database Definition Files

A source file which registers simple static variables and
record/device/driver support routines with iocsh can be created. The
list of variables and routines to register is obtained from lines in an
existing dbd file.

The following line in a Makefile will result in
`<name>_registerRecordDeviceDriver.cpp` being created, compiled, and
linked into `<prodname>`. It requires that the file `<name>.dbd` exist
or can be created using other make rules.

```
<prodname>_SRCS += <name>_registerRecordDeviceDriver.cpp
```

An example of registering the variable `mySubDebug` and the routines
`mySubInit` and `mySubProcess` is `<name>.dbd` containg the following lines

```
variable(mySubDebug)
function(mySubInit)
function(mySubProcess)
```

### Database Definition Files

The following line installs the existing named dbd files into
`$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/dbd` without expansion.

```
DBD += <name>.dbd
```

### DBD install files

Definitions of the form:

```
DBD_INSTALLS += <name>
```

result in files being installed to the `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/dbd`
directory. The file `<name>` can appear with or without a directory
prefix. If the file has a directory prefix e.g. `$(APPNAME)/dbd/`, it is
copied from the specified location. If a directory prefix is not
present, make will look in the current source directory for the file.

### Database Files

For most databases just the name of the database has to be specified.
Make will figure out how to generate the file:

```
DB += xxx.db
```

generates `xxx.db` depending on which source files exist and installs it
into `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/db`.

A `<name>.db` database file will be created from an optional
`<name>.template` file and/or an optional `<name>.substitutions` file.
If the substitution file exists but the template file is not named
`<name>.template`, the template file name can be specified as

```
<name>_TEMPLATE = <template file name>
```

A `*<nn>.db` database file will be created from a `*.template` and a
`*<nn>.substitutions` file, (where nn is an optional index number).

If a `<name>` substitutions file contains "file" references to other
input files, these referenced files are made dependencies of the created
`<name>.db` by the `makeDbDepends.pl` perl tool.

The {doc}`epics-base:msi` will be used to generate
the database, and msi must either be in your path or you must redefine
`MSI` as the full path name to the msi binary in a `RELEASE` file or
Makefile. An example `MSI` definition is

```makefile
MSI = /usr/local/epics/extensions/bin/${EPICS_HOST_ARCH}/msi
```

Template files `<name>.template`, and db files, `<name>.db`, will be
created from an edf file `<name>.edf` and an `<name>.edf` file will be
created from a `<name>.sch` file.

Template and substitution files can be installed.

```
DB += xxx.template xxx.substitutions
```

generates and installs these files. If one or more `xxx.substitutions`
files are to be created by script, the script name must be placed in the
`CREATESUBSTITUTIONS` variable (e.g. `CREATESUBSTITUTIONS=mySubst.pl`). This
script will be executed by gnumake with the prefix of the substitution
file name to be generated as its argument. If (and only if) there are
script generated substitutions files, the prefix of any inflated
database's name may not equal the prefix of the name of any template
used within the directory.

### DB install files

Definitions of the form:

```
DB_INSTALLS += <name>
```

result in files being installed to the `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/db` directory.
The file `<name>` can appear with or without a directory prefix. If the
file has a directory prefix e.g. `$(APPNAME)/db/`, it is copied from the
specified location. If a directory prefix is not present, make will look
in the current source directory for the file.

### Compile and link command options

Any of the following can be specified:

#### Options for all compile/link commands.

These definitions will apply to all compiler and linker targets.

```
USR_INCLUDES += -I<name>

### Libraries

A library is created and installed into
`$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/lib/<arch>` by specifying its name and the name of
the object and/or source files containing code for the library. An
object or source file name can appear with or without a directory
prefix. If the file name has a directory prefix e.g. `$(EPICS_BASE_BIN)`,
it is taken from the specified location. If a directory prefix is not
present, make will first look in the source directories for a file with
the specified name and next try to create the file using existing
configure rules. A library filename prefix may be prepended to the
library name when the file is created. For Unix type systems and vxWorks
the library prefix is lib and there is no prefix for WIN32. Also a
library suffix appropriate for the library type and target arch (e.g.
.a, .so, .lib, .dll) will be appended to the filename when the file is
created.

```{admonition} vxWorks and RTEMS
Only archive libraries are created.
```

```{admonition} Shared libraries
Shared libraries can be built for any or all
HOST type architectures. The definition of `SHARED_LIBRARIES` (YES/NO)
in `base/configure/CONFIG_SITE` determines whether shared or archive
libraries will be built. When `SHARED_LIBRARIES` is `YES`, both archive
and shared libraries are built. This definition can be overridden for a
specific arch in an `configure/os/CONFIG_SITE.<arch>.Common` file. The
default definition for `SHARED_LIBRARIES` in the EPICS base
distribution file is `YES` for all host systems.
```

```{admonition} Win32
An object library file is created when `SHARED_LIBRARIES=NO`,
`<name>.lib` which is installed into `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/lib/<arch>`.
Two library files are created when `SHARED_LIBRARIES=YES`, `<name>.lib`,
an import library for DLLs, which is installed into
`$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/lib/<arch>`, and `<name>.dll` which is installed
into `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/bin/<arch>`. (Warning: The file `<name>.lib`
will only be created by the build if there are exported symbols from the
library.) If `SHARED_LIBRARIES=YES`, the directory
`$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/bin/<arch>` must be in the user's path during
builds to allow invoking executables which were linked with shared
libraries.
```

Note that the `<name>.lib` files are different for shared and nonshared
builds.

#### Specifying the library name.

Any of the following can be specified:

```
LIBRARY += <name>
```

A library will be created for every target arch.

```
LIBRARY_<osclass> += <name>
```

Library `<name>` will be created for all archs of the specified
osclass.

```
LIBRARY_DEFAULT += <name>

LIBRARY_IOC += <name>
```

Library `<name>` will be created for IOC type archs.

```
LIBRARY_IOC_<osclass> += <name>
```

Library `<name>` will be created for all IOC type archs of the
specified osclass.

```
LIBRARY_IOC_DEFAULT += <name>
```

Library `<name>` will be created for any IOC type arch that does not
have a `LIBRARY_IOC_<osclass>` definition

```
LIBRARY_HOST += <name>
```

Library `<name>` will be created for HOST type archs.

```
LIBRARY_HOST_<osclass> += <name>
```

Library `<name>` will be created for all HOST type archs of the
specified osclass.

```
LIBRARY_HOST_DEFAULT += <name>
```

Library `<name>` will be created for any HOST type arch that does not
have a `LIBRARY_HOST_<osclass>` definition

#### Specifying library source file names

```
SRCS += <name>
```

Source files will be used for all defined libraries and products.

```

Source files will be used for all defined libraries and products for
all archs of the specified osclass.

```

#### Specifying library object file names

Library object file names should only be specified for object files
which will not be built in the current directory. For object files built
in the current directory, library source file names should be specified.
See Specifying Library Source File Names above.

Object files which have filename with a ".o" or ".obj" suffix are
defined as follows and can be specified without the suffix but should
have the directory prefix

```
USR_OBJS += <name>
```

Object files will be used in builds of all products and libraries

```
USR_OBJS_<osclass> += <name>
```

Object files will be used in builds of all products and libraries for

xyzLib) are defined as follows:

```
USR_OBJLIBS += <name>
```

Combined object files will be used in builds of all libraries and
products.

```

#### LIBOBJS definitions

Previous versions of epics (3.13 and before) accepted definitions like:

```makefile
LIBOBJS += $(<support>_BIN)/xxx.o
```

These are gathered together in files such as baseLIBOBJS. To use such
definitions include the lines:

```
-include ../baseLIBOBJS
<libname>_OBJS += $(LIBOBJS)
```

```{admonition} Note:
vxWorks applications created by `makeBaseApp.pl` from 3.14 Base
releases no longer have a file named baseLIBOBJS. Base record and
device support now exists in archive libraries.*
```

#### Specifying dependant libraries to be linked when creating a library

For each library name specified which is not a system library nor a
library from an EPICS top defined in the `configure/RELEASE` file, a
`<name>_DIR` definition must be present in the Makefile to specify the
location of the library.

Library names, which must not have a directory and "lib" prefix nor a
suffix, are defined as follows:

```
LIB_LIBS += <name>
```

Libraries to be used when linking all defined libraries.

```
LIB_LIBS_<osclass> += <name>
```

Libraries to be used or all archs of the specified osclass when
linking all defined libraries.

```
LIB_LIBS_DEFAULT += <name>
```

Libraries to be used for any arch that does not have a
`LIB_LIBS_<osclass>` definition when linking all defined libraries.

```
USR_LIBS += <name>
```

Libraries to be used when linking all defined products and libraries.

```
USR_LIBS_<osclass> += <name>
```

Libraries to be used or all archs of the specified osclasswhen linking
all defined products and libraries.

```
USR_LIBS_DEFAULT += <name>
```

Libraries to be used for any arch that does not have a
`USR_LIBS_<osclass>` definition when linking all defined products
and libraries.

```
<libname>_LIBS += <name>
```

Libraries to be used for linking the named library.

```
<libname>_LIBS_<osclass> += <name>
```

Libraries will be used for all archs of the specified osclass for
linking named library.

```
<libname>_LIBS_DEFAULT += <name>
```

Libraries to be used for any arch that does not have a
`<libname>_LIBS_<osclass>` definition when linking named
library.

```
<libname>_SYS_LIBS += <name>
```

System libraries to be used for linking the named library.

```
<libname>_SYS_LIBS_<osclass> += <name>
```

System libraries will be used for all archs of the specified osclass
for linking named library.

```
<libname>_SYS_LIBS_DEFAULT += <name>
```

System libraries to be used for any arch that does not have a
`<libname>_LIBS_<osclass>` definition when linking named
library.


#### The order of dependant libraries

Dependant library names appear in the following order on a library link
line:

1.  `<libname>_LIBS`
2.  `<libname>_LIBS_<osclass>` or `<libname>_LIBS_DEFAULT`
3.  `LIB_LIBS`
4.  `LIB_LIBS_<osclass>` or `LIB_LIBS_DEFAULT`
5.  `USR_LIBS`
6.  `USR_LIBS_<osclass>` or `USR_LIBS_DEFAULT`
7.  `<libname>_SYS_LIBS`
8.  `<libname>_SYS_LIBS_<osclass>` or `<libname>_SYS_LIBS_DEFAULT`
9.  `LIB_SYS_LIBS`
10. `LIB_SYS_LIBS_<osclass>` or `LIB_SYS_LIBS_DEFAULT`
11. `USR_SYS_LIBS`
12. `USR_SYS_LIBS_<osclass>` or `USR_SYS_LIBS_DEFAULT`

#### Specifying library DLL file names (deprecated)

WIN32 libraries require all external references to be resolved, so if a
library contains references to items in other DLL libraries, these DLL
library names must be specified (without directory prefix and without
".dll" suffix) as follows:

```
DLL_LIBS += <name>
```

These DLLs will be used for all libraries.

```
<libname>_DLL_LIBS += <name>
```

These DLLs will be used for the named library.

Each `<name>` must have a corresponding `<name>_DIR` definition
specifying its directory location.


#### Specifying shared library version number

A library version number can be specified when creating a shared library
as follows:

```
SHRLIB_VERSION = <version>
```

On WIN32 this results in `/version:$(SHRLIB_VERSION)` link option. On Unix type
hosts `.$(SHRLIB_VERSION)` is appended to the shared library name and a symbolic
link is created for the unversioned library name.
`$(EPICS_VERSION).$(EPICS_REVISION)` is the default value for `SHRLIB_VERSION`.

#### Library example:

```makefile
LIBRARY_vxWorks += vxWorksOnly
LIBRARY_IOC += iocOnly
LIBRARY_HOST += hostOnly
LIBRARY += all
vxWorksOnly_OBJS += $(LINAC_BIN)/vxOnly1
vxWorksOnly_SRCS += vxOnly2.c
iocOnly_OBJS += $(LINAC_BIN)/iocOnly1
iocOnly_SRCS += iocOnly2.cpp
hostOnly_OBJS += $(LINAC_BIN)/host1
all_OBJS += $(LINAC_BIN)/all1
all_SRCS += all2.cpp
```

If the architectures defined in `<top>/configure` are solaris-sparc and
vxWorks-68040 and LINAC is defined in the `<top>/configure/RELEASE`
file, then the following libraries will be created:

* `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/bin/vxWork-68040/libvxWorksOnly.a` :
  `$(LINAC_BIN)/vxOnly1.o` `vxOnly2.o`
* `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/bin/vxWork-68040/libiocOnly.a` :
  `$(LINAC_BIN/iocOnly1.o` `iocOnly2.o`
* `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/lib/solaris-sparc/libiocOnly.a` :
  `$(LINAC_BIN)/iocOnly1.o` `iocOnly2.o`
* `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/lib/solaris-sparc/libhostOnly.a` :
  `$(LINAC_BIN)/host1.o`
* `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/bin/vxWork-68040/liball.a` :
  `$(LINAC_BIN)/all1.o` `all2.o`
* `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/lib/solaris-sparc/liball.a` :
  `$(LINAC_BIN)/all1.o` `all2.o`

### Loadable libraries

Loadable libraries are regular libraries which are not required to have
all symbols resolved during the build. The intent is to create dynamic
plugins so no archive library is created. Source file, object files, and
dependant libraries are specified in exactly the same way as for regular
libraries.

Any of the following can be specified:

```
LOADABLE_LIBRARY += <name>
```

The `<name>` loadable library will be created for every target arch.

```
LOADABLE_LIBRARY_<osclass> += <name>
```

Loadable library `<name>` will be created for all archs of the
specified osclass.

```
LOADABLE_LIBRARY_DEFAULT += <name>
```

Loadable library `<name>` will be created for any arch that does not
have a `LOADABLE_LIBRARY_<osclass>` definition

```
LOADABLE_LIBRARY_HOST += <name>
```

Loadable library `<name>` will be created for HOST type archs.

```
LOADABLE_LIBRARY_HOST_<osclass> += <name>
```

Loadable library `<name>` will be created for all HOST type archs of
the specified osclass.

```
LOADABLE_LIBRARY_HOST_DEFAULT += <name>
```

Loadable library `<name>` will be created for any HOST type arch that does not
have a `LOADABLE_LIBRARY_HOST_<osclass>` definition


### Combined object libraries (VxWorks only)

Combined object libraries are regular combined object files which have
been created by linking together multiple object files. `OBJLIB`
specifications in the Makefile create a combined object file and a
corresponding munch file for vxWorks target architectures only. Combined
object libraries have a Library.o suffix. It is possible to generate and
install combined object libraries by using definitions:

```makefile
OBJLIB += <name> 
OBJLIB_vxWorks += <name>
OBJLIB_SRCS += <srcname1> <srcname2> ...
OBJLIB_OBJS += <objname1> <objname2> ...
```

These definitions result in the combined object file `<name>Library.o`
and its corresponding `<name>Library.munch` munch file being built for
each vxWorks architecture from source/object files in the
OBJLIB_SRCS/OBJLIB_OBJS definitions. The combined object file and the
munch file are installed into the `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/bin/<arch>`
directory.

### Object Files

It is possible to generate and install object files by using
definitions:

```
OBJS += <name>
OBJS_<osclass> += <name>
OBJS_DEFAULT += <name>
OBJS_IOC += <name>
OBJS_IOC_<osclass> += <name>
OBJS_IOC_DEFAULT += <name>
OBJS_HOST += <name>
OBJS_HOST_<osclass> += <name>
OBJS_HOST_DEFAULT += <name>
```

These will cause the specified file to be generated from an existing
source file for the appropriate target arch and installed into
`$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/bin/<arch>`.

The following Makefile will create the abc object file for all target
architectures, the def object file for all target archs except vxWorks,
and the xyz object file only for the vxWorks target architecture and
install them into the appropriate `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/bin/<arch>`
directory.

```makefile
TOP=../../..
include $(TOP)/configure/CONFIG
OBJS += abc
OBJS_vxWorks += xyz
OBJS_DEFAULT += def
include $(TOP)/configure/RULES
```

### State Notation Programs

A state notation program file can be specified as a source file in any
`SRC` definition. For example:

```
<prodname>_SRCS += <name>.stt
```

The state notation compiler `snc` will generate the file `<name>.c` from
the state notation program file `<name>.stt`. This C file is compiled
and the resulting object file is linked into the `<prodname>` product.

A state notation source file must have the extension .st or .stt. The
.st file is passed through the C preprocessor before it is processed by
snc.

If you have state notation language source files (.stt and .st files),
the module seq must be built and `SNCSEQ` defined in the `RELEASE` file. If
the state notation language source files require c preprocessing before
conversion to c source (.st files), gcc must be in your path.

### Scripts, etc.

Any of the following can be specified:

```
SCRIPTS += <name>
```

A script will be installed from the src directory to the
`$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/bin/<arch>` directories.

```
SCRIPTS_<osclass> += <name>
```

Script `<name>` will be installed for all archs of the specified
osclass.

```
SCRIPTS_DEFAULT += <name>
```

Script `<name>` will be installed for any arch that does not have a
`SCRIPTS_<osclass>` definition

```
SCRIPTS_IOC += <name>
```

Script `<name>` will be installed for IOC type archs.

```
SCRIPTS_IOC_<osclass> += <name>
```

Script `<name>` will be installed for all IOC type archs of the
specified osclass.

```
SCRIPTS_IOC_DEFAULT += <name>
```

Script `<name>` will be installed for any IOC type arch that does not
have a `SCRIPTS_IOC_<osclass>` definition

```
SCRIPTS_HOST += <name>
```

Script `<name>` will be installed for HOST type archs.

```
SCRIPTS_HOST_<osclass> += <name>
```

Script `<name>` will be installed for all HOST type archs of the
specified osclass.

```
SCRIPTS_HOST_DEFAULT += <name>
```

Script `<name>` will be installed for any HOST type arch that does not
have a `SCRIPTS_HOST_<osclass>` definition

Definitions of the form:

```
SCRIPTS_<osclass> += <name1>
SCRIPTS_DEFAULT += <name2>
```

results in the <name1> script being installed from the src directory
to the `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/bin/<arch>` directories for all target
archs of the specified os class <osclass> and the <name2> script
installed into the `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/bin/<arch>` directories of all
other target archs.

### Include files

A definition of the form:

```
INC += <name>.h
```

results in file `<name>.h` being installed or created and installed to
the `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/include` directory.

Definitions of the form:

```
INC_DEFAULT += <name>.h
INC_<osclass> += <name>.h
```

results in file `<name>.h` being installed or created and installed into
the appropriate `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/include/os/<osclass>` directory.

### Html and Doc files

A definition of the form:

```
HTMLS_DIR = <dirname>
HTMLS += <name>
```

results in file `<name>` being installed from the src directory to the
`$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/html/<dirname>` directory.

A definition of the form:

```
DOCS += <name>
```

results in file `<name>` being installed from the src directory to the
`$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/doc` directory.

### Templates

Adding definitions of the form

```
TEMPLATES_DIR = <dirname>
TEMPLATES += <name>
```

results in the file `<name>` being installed from the src directory to
the `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/templates/<dirname>` directory. If a directory
structure of template files is to be installed, the template file names
may include a directory prefix.

### Lex and yacc

If a `<name>.c` source file specified in a Makefile definition is not
found in the source directory, gnumake will try to build it from
`<name>.y` and `<name>_lex.l` files in the source directory. Lex
converts a `<name>.l` Lex code file to a `lex.yy.c` file which the build
rules renames to `<name>.c`. Yacc converts a `<name>.y` yacc code file
to a `y.tab.c` file, which the build rules renames to `<name>.c`.
Optionally yacc can create a `y.tab.h` file which the build rules renames
to `<name>.h`.

### Products

A product executable is created for each <arch> and installed into
`$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/bin/<arch>` by specifying its name and the name of
either the object or source files containing code for the product. An
object or source file name can appear with or without a directory
prefix. Object files should contain a directory prefix. If the file has
a directory prefix e.g. `$(EPICS_BASE_BIN)`, the file is taken from the
specified location. If a directory prefix is not present, make will look
in the source directories for a file with the specified name or try
build it using existing rules. An executable filename suffix appropriate
for the target arch (e.g. .exe) may be appended to the filename when the
file is created.

PROD specifications in the Makefile for vxWorks target architectures
create a combined object file with library references resolved and a
corresponding .munch file.

```
PROD_HOST += <name>
<name>_SRC += <srcname>.c
```

results in the executable `<name>` being built for each HOST
architecture, `<arch>`, from a `<srcname>.c` file. Then `<name>` is
installed into the `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/bin/<arch>` directory.

#### Specifying the product name.

Any of the following can be specified:

```
PROD += <name>
```

Product `<name>` will be created for every target arch.

```
PROD_<osclass> += <name>
```

Product `<name>` will be created for all archs of the specified
osclass.

```
PROD_DEFAULT += <name>
```

Product `<name>` will be created for any arch that does not have a
`PROD_<osclass>` definition

PROD_IOC += <name>
```

Product `<name>` will be created for IOC type archs.

```
PROD_IOC_<osclass> += <name>
```

#### Specifying libraries to be linked when creating the product

For each library name specified which is not a system library nor a
library from EPICS base, a `<name>_DIR` definition must be present in
the Makefile to specify the location of the library.

Library names, which must not have a directory and "lib" prefix nor a
suffix, are defined as follows:

```
PROD_LIBS += <name>
```

Libraries to be used when linking all defined products.

```
PROD_LIBS_<osclass> += <name>
```

Libraries to be used or all archs of the specified osclass when

for linking named product.

```
<prodname>_SYS_LIBS_DEFAULT += <name>
```

System libraries to be used for any arch that does not have a

#### The order of dependant libraries

Dependant library names appear in the following order on a product link
line:

1.  `<prodname>_LIBS`
2.  `<prodname>_LIBS_<osclass>` or `<prodname>_LIBS_DEFAULT`
3.  `PROD_LIBS`
4.  `PROD_LIBS_<osclass>` or `PROD_LIBS_DEFAULT`
5.  `USR_LIBS`
6.  `USR_LIBS_<osclass>` or `USR_LIBS_DEFAULT`
7.  `<prodname>_SYS_LIBS`
8.  `<prodname>_SYS_LIBS_<osclass>` or `<prodname>_SYS_LIBS_DEFAULT`
9.  `PROD_SYS_LIBS`
10. `PROD_SYS_LIBS_<osclass>` or `PROD_SYS_LIBS_DEFAULT`
11. `USR_SYS_LIBS`
12. `USR_SYS_LIBS_<osclass>` or `USR_SYS_LIBS_DEFAULT`

#### Specifying product version number

On WIN32 only a product version number can be specified as follows:

```
PROD_VERSION += <version>
```

This results in `/version:$(PROD_VERSION)` link option.

#### Generate version header

A header can be generated which defines a single string macro with an
automatically generated identifier. The default is the ISO 8601
formatted time of the build. A revision id is used if a supported
version control system is present. This will typically be used to make
an automatically updated source version number visible at runtime (eg.
with a stringin record).

To enable this the variable `GENVERSION` must be set with the desired name
of the generated header. By default this variable is empty and no header
will be generated. If specified, this variable must be set before
`configure/RULES` is included.

It is also necessary to add an explicit dependency for each source file
which includes the generated header.

An Makefile which generates a version header named `myversion.h`
included by `devVersionString.c` would have the following.

```makefile
TOP=../..
include $(TOP)/configure/CONFIG
# ... define PROD or LIBRARY names sometarget
sometarget_SRCS = devVersionString.c
GENVERSION = myversion.h
include $(TOP)/configure/RULES
# for each source file
devVersionString$(DEP): $(GENVERSION)
```

The optional variables `GENVERSIONMACRO` and `GENVERSIONDEFAULT` give the
name of the C macro which will be defined in the generated header, and
its default value if no version control system is being used. To avoid
conflicts, the macro name must be changed from its default `MODULEVERSION`
if the version header is to be installed.

#### Product static builds

Product executables can be linked with either archive versions or shared
versions of EPICS libraries. Shared versions of system libraries will
always be used in product linking. The definition of `STATIC_BUILD`
(`YES`/`NO`) in `base/configure/CONFIG_SITE` determines which EPICS libraries
to use. When `STATIC_BUILD` is `NO`, shared libraries will be used.
(`SHARED_LIBRARIES` must be set to `YES`.) The default definition for
`STATIC_BUILD` in the EPICS base `CONFIG_SITE` distribution file is `NO`. A
`STATIC_BUILD` definition in a Makefile will override the definition in
`CONFIG_SITE`. Static builds may not be possible on all systems. For static
builds, all nonsystem libraries must have an archive version, and this
may not be true form all libraries.

### Test Products

Test products are product executables that are created but not installed
into `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/bin/<arch>` directories. Test product
libraries, source, and object files are specified in exactly the same
way as regular products.

Any of the following can be specified:

```
TESTPROD += <name>
```

Test product `<name>` will be created for every target arch.

```
TESTPROD_<osclass> += <name>
```

Test product `<name>` will be created for all archs of the specified
osclass.

```
TESTPROD_DEFAULT += <name>
```

Test product `<name>` will be created for any arch that does not
have a `TESTPROD_<osclass>` definition

```
TESTPROD_IOC += <name>
```

Test product `<name>` will be created for IOC type archs.

```
TESTPROD_IOC_<osclass> += <name>
```

Test product `<name>` will be created for all IOC type archs of the
specified osclass.

```
TESTPROD_IOC_DEFAULT += <name>
```

Test product `<name>` will be created for any IOC type arch that
does not have a `TESTPROD_IOC_<osclass>` definition

```
TESTPROD_HOST += <name>
```

Test product `<name>` will be created for HOST type archs.

```
TESTPROD_HOST_<osclass> += <name>
```

Test product `<name>` will be created for all HOST type archs of the
specified osclass.

```
TESTPROD_HOST_DEFAULT += <name>
```

Test product `<name>` will be created for any HOST type arch that
does not have a `TESTPROD_HOST_<osclass>` definition

### Test Scripts

Test scripts are perl scripts whose names end in .t that get executed to
satisfy the runtests make target. They are run by the perl Test::Harness
library, and should send output to stdout following the Test Anything
Protocol. Any of the following can be specified, although only
`TESTSCRIPTS_HOST` is currently useful:

```
TESTSCRIPTS += <name>
```

Test script `<name>` will be created for every target arch.

```
TESTSCRIPTS_<osclass> += <name>
```

Test script `<name>` will be created for all archs of the specified
osclass.

```
TESTSCRIPTS_DEFAULT += <name>
```

Test script `<name>` will be created for any arch that does not have
a `TESTSCRIPTS_<osclass>` definition

```
TESTSCRIPTS_IOC += <name>
```

Test script `<name>` will be created for IOC type archs.

```
TESTSCRIPTS_IOC_<osclass> += <name>
```

Test script `<name>` will be created for all IOC type archs of the
specified osclass.

```
TESTSCRIPTS_IOC_DEFAULT += <name>
```

Test script `<name>` will be created for any IOC type arch that does
not have a `TESTSCRIPTS_IOC_<osclass>` definition

```
TESTSCRIPTS_HOST += <name>
```

Test script `<name>` will be created for HOST type archs.

```
TESTSCRIPTS_HOST_<osclass> += <name>
```

Test script `<name>` will be created for all HOST type archs of the
specified osclass.

```
TESTSCRIPTS_HOST_DEFAULT += <name>
```

Test script `<name>` will be created for any HOST type arch that
does not have a `TESTSCRIPTS_HOST_<osclass>` definition.

If a name in one of the above variables matches a regular executable
program name (normally generated as a test product) with `.t`
appended, a suitable perl script will be generated that will execute
that program directly; this makes it simple to run programs that use the
epicsUnitTest routines in libCom. A test script written in Perl with a
name ending `.plt` will be copied into the `O.<arch>` directory with the
ending changed to `.t`; such scripts will usually use the perl
`Test::Simple` or `Test::More` libraries.

### Miscellaneous Targets

A definition of the form:

```
TARGETS += <name>
```

results in the file `<name>` being built in the `O.<arch>` directory
from existing rules and files in the source directory. These target
files are not installed.

### Installing Other Binaries

Definitions of the form:

```
BIN_INSTALLS += <name>
BIN_INSTALLS += <dir>/<name>
BIN_INSTALLS_DEFAULT += <name>
BIN_INSTALLS_<osclass> += <name>
```

will result in the named files being installed to the appropriate
`$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/bin/<arch>` directory. The file `<name>` can
appear with or without a directory prefix. If the file has a directory
prefix e.g. `$(EPICS_BASE_BIN)`, it is copied from the specified
location. If a directory prefix is not present, make will look in the
source directory for the file.

### Installing Other Libraries

Definitions of the form:

```
LIB_INSTALLS += <name>
LIB_INSTALLS += <dir>/<name>
LIB_INSTALLS_DEFAULT += <name>
LIB_INSTALLS_<osclass> += <name>
```

result in files being installed to the appropriate
`$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/lib/<arch>` directory. The file `<name>` can
appear with or without a directory prefix. If the file has a directory
prefix e.g. `$(EPICS_BASE_LIB)`, it is copied from the specified
location. If a directory prefix is not present, make will look in the
source directory for the file.

### Win32 resource files

Definitions of the following forms result in resource files (`*.res` files)
being created from the specified `*.rc` resource definition script files and
linked into the prods and/or libraries.

```
RCS += <name> 
RCS_<osclass> += <name>
```

Resource definition script files for all products and libraries.

```
PROD_RCS += <name> 
PROD_RCS_<osclass> += <name>
PROD_RCS_DEFAULT += <name>
```

Resource definition script files for all products.

```
LIB_RCS += <name> 
LIB_RCS_<osclass> += <name>
LIB_RCS_DEFAULT += <name>
```

Resource definition script files for all libraries.

```
<name>_RCS += <name> 
<name>_RCS_<osclass> += <name>
<name>_RCS_DEFAULT += <name>
```

Resource definition script files for specified product or library.

### TCL libraries

Definitions of the form:

```
TCLLIBNAME += <name>
TCLINDEX += <name>
```

result in the specified tcl files being installed to the
`$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/lib/<arch>` directory.

### Java class files

Java class files can be created by the `javac` tool into `$(INSTALL_JAVA)`
or into the `O.Common` subdirectory, by specifying the name of the java
class file in the Makefile. Command line options for the `javac` tool can
be specified. The configuration files set the java c option
`-sourcepath .:..:../..`.

Any of the following can be specified:

```
JAVA += <name>.java
```

The `<name>.java` file will be used to create the `<name>.class` file
in the `$(INSTALL_JAVA)` directory.

```
TESTJAVA += <name>.java
```

The `<name>.java` files will be used to create the `<name>.class` file
in the `O.Common` subdirectory.

```
USR_JAVACFLAGS += <name>
```

The `javac` option `<name>` will be used on the `javac` command lines.

#### Example 1

In this example, three class files are created in
`$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/javalib/mytest`. The `javac` depreciation flag is used
to list the description of each use or override of a deprecated member
or class.

```makefile
JAVA = mytest/one.java
JAVA = mytest/two.java
JAVA = mytest/three.java
USR_JAVACFLAGS = -deprecation
```

#### Example 2

In this example, the `test.class` file is created in the `O.Common`
subdirectory.

```
TESTJAVA = test.java
```

### Java jar file

A single java jar file can be created using the java jar tool and installed into
`$(INSTALL_JAVA)` (i.e. `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/javalib`) by specifying its name,
and the names of its input files to be included in the created jar file. The jar
input file names must appear with a directory prefix.

Any of the following can be specified:

```
JAR += <name>
```

The `<name>` jar file will be created and installed into the
`$(INSTALL_JAVA)` directory.

```
JAR_INPUT += <name>
```

Names of images, audio files and classes files to be included in the
jar file.

```
JAR_MANIFEST += <name>
```

The preexisting manifest file will be used for the created jar file.

```
JAR_PACKAGES += <name>
```

Names of java packages to be installed and added to the created jar
file.

#### Example 3

In this example, all the class files created by the current Makefile's
`JAVA +=` definitions, are placed into a file named `mytest1.jar`. A
manifest file will be automatically generated for the jar.


```{admonition} Note
`$(INSTALL_CLASSES)` is set to `$(addprefix $(INSTALL_JAVA)/,$(CLASSES))`
in the EPICS base configure files.
```

```makefile
JAR = mytest1.jar
JAR_INPUT = $(INSTALL_CLASSES)
```

#### Example 4

In this example, three class files are created and placed into a new jar
archive file named `mytest2.jar`. An existing manifest file, `mytest2.mf` is
put into the new jar file.

```makefile
JAR = mytest2.jar
JAR_INPUT = $(INSTALL_JAVA)/mytest/one.class
JAR_INPUT = $(INSTALL_JAVA)/mytest/two.class
JAR_INPUT = $(INSTALL_JAVA)/mytest/three.class
JAR_MANIFEST = mytest2.mf
```

### Java native method C header files

A C header files for use with java native methods will be created by the
`javah` tool in the `O.Common` subdirectory by specifying the name of the
header file to be created. The name of the java class file used to
generate the header is derived from the name of the header file.
Underscores `_` are used as a header file name delimiter. Command line
options for the `javah` tool can be specified.

Any of the following can be specified:

```
JAVAINC += <name>.h
```

The `<name>.h` header file will be created in the `O.Common`
subdirectory.

```
USR_JAVAHFLAGS += <name>
```

The `javah` option `<name>` will be used on the `javah` tool command line.

#### Example 5

In this example, the C header `xx_yy_zz.h` will be created in the
`$(COMMON_DIR)` subdirectory from the class `xx.yy.zz` (i.e. the java class
file `$(INSTALL_JAVA)/xx/yy/zz.class`)). The option `-old` will tell
`javah` to create old JDK1.0 style header files.

```makefile
JAVAINC = xx_yy_zz.h
USR_JAVAHFLAGS = -old
```

### User Created `CONFIG*` and `RULES*` files

Module developers can now create new `CONFIG` and `RULES*` files ia a
`<top>` application source directory. These new `CONFIG*` or `RULES*`
files will be installed into the directory `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/cfg` by
including lines like the following Makefile line:

```makefile
CFG += CONFIG_MY1 RULES_MY1
```

The build will install the new files `CONFIG_MY1` and `RULES_MY1` into the
`$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/cfg` directory.

Files in a `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/cfg` directory are now included during a
build by so that the definitions and rules in them are available for use
by later src directory Makefiles in the same module or by other modules
with a `RELEASE` line pointing to the `TOP` of this module.

### User Created File Types

Module developers can now define a new type of file, e.g. `ABC`, so that
files of type `ABC` will be installed into a directory defined by
`INSTALL_ABC`. This is done by creating a new `CONFIG_<name>` file,
e.g. `CONFIG_ABC`, with the following lines:

```makefile
FILE_TYPE += ABC
INSTALL_ABC = $(INSTALL_LOCATION)/abc
```

The `INSTALL_ABC` directory should be a subdirectory of
`$(INSTALL_LOCATION)`. The file type `ABC` should be target architecture
independent (alh files, medm files, edm files.

Optional rules necessary for files of type `ABC` should be put in a
`RULES_ABC` file.

The module developer installs new `CONFIG_ABC` and `RULES_ABC` files for the
new file type into the directory `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/cfg` by including
the following Makefile line:

```makefile
CFG += CONFIG_ABC RULES_ABC
```

Files of type `ABC` are installed into `INSTALL_ABC` directory by adding a
line like the following to a Makefile.

```makefile
ABC += <filename1> <filename2> <filename3>
```

Since the files in `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/cfg` directory are now included
by the base config files, the `ABC +=` definition lines are available for
use by later src directory Makefiles in the same module or by other
modules with a `RELEASE` line pointing to the `TOP` of this module.

### Assemblies

A single output file is generated from assembling specified snippet
files. Snippet file names start with numbers and are sorted when the
snippets are concatenated: first by the number, then alphabetical by the
remaining part of the name. (This mechanism is conceptually similar to
the Linux convention of collecting configuration file snippets in *.d
directories.)

Snippets with file names not starting with a number or ending in '~'
are ignored. The specified snippets are processed in the order they
appear on the command line. Multiple snippets with the same number are
concatenated. "Commands" (tags in the snippet name) can be used to
control the treatment of snippets with the same number:

-   D - Default. Snippet is treated as a default, which is replaced
    (overwritten) by any other snippet with the same number.
-   R - Replace. Snippet is replacing (overwriting) already processed
    snippets with the same number.

Specification of the target file is different for architecture dependent
or independent files.

```makefile
COMMON_ASSEMBLIES += st.cmd
ASSEMBLIES += mytool.rc
```

Snippet files are configured specifically (relative or absolute path) or
as patterns (searched relative to all source directories).

```makefile
mytool.rc_SNIPPETS += ../rc.d/10_head ../rc.d/20_init
st.cmd_PATTERN += st.cmd.d/*
```

#### Macros

The following macros can be used in snippets, and will be replaced by
the current value when assembling is done.

* `DATETIME` Date and time of the build
* `USERNAME` Name of the user running the build
* `HOST` Name of the host on which the build is run
* `OUTPUTFILE` Name of the generated file
* `SNIPPETFILE` Name of the current snippet

#### Example 6

This mechanism can be used to create an IOC startup file from snippets
in a global and an application specific directory, allowing applications
to add commands to different phases of the IOC startup by dropping
appropriately numbered snippets into the directory.

Given the following directories and snippets:

```
/global/st.cmd.d/
├── D10_init
├── 20_environment
├── 30_drivers
├── D40_settings
└── 70_start-ioc
```

```
../st.cmd.d/
├── D10_init
├── 40_settings
├── 40_settings~       # backup file
├── 30_another-driver
└── R70_start-my-ioc
```

And the following Makefile declaration:

```makefile
SCRIPTS += $(COMMON_DIR)/st.cmd
COMMON_ASSEMBLIES += st.cmd
st.cmd_SNIPPETS += $(wildcard /global/st.cmd.d/*)
st.cmd_PATTERN += st.cmd.d/*
```

The build will create and install a st.cmd script using the following
snippets:

| Source  | Snippet                    | Comment                                    |
| ------  | -------                    | -------                                    |
| L       | 10_init                    | L default resets the G default             |
| G       | 20_environment             |                                            |
| L       | 30_another-driver          | implicit addition, alphabetical sorting    |
| G       | 30_drivers                 |                                            |
| L       | 40_settings                | replacing a default, ignoring backup file  |
| L       | 70_start-my-ioc            | explicit replace                           |


## Table of Makefile definitions

Definitions given below containing `<osclass>` are used when building
for target archs of a specific osclass, and the `<osclass>` part of the
name should be replaced by the desired osclass, e.g. solaris, vxWorks,
etc. If a `_DEFAULT` setting is given but a particular `<osclass>`
requires that the default not apply and there are no items in the
definition that apply for that `<osclass>`, the value `-nil-` should
be specified in the relevant Makefile definition.

## Configuration Files

### Base Configure Directory

The base/configure directory has the following directory structure:

```
base/
├──-configure/
    ├── os/ 
    ├── tools/
```

### Base Configure File Descriptions

The configure files contain definitions and make rules to be included in the various makefiles.

`CONFIG.CrossCommon`

Definitions for all hosts and all targets for a cross build (host different than target).

`CONFIG.gnuCommon`

Definitions for all hosts and all targets for builds using the gnu compiler.

`CONFIG_ADDONS`

Definitions which setup the variables that have <osclass> and DEFAULT options.

`CONFIG_APP_INCLUDE`

Definitions to generate include, bin, lib, perl module, db, and dbd
directory definitions for `RELEASE` \<top\>s.

`CONFIG_BASE`

EPICS base specific definitions.

`CONFIG_BASE_VERSION`

Definitions for the version number of EPICS base. This file is used
for creating `epicsVersion.h` which is installed into base/include.

`CONFIG_COMMON`

Definitions common to all builds.

`CONFIG_ENV`

Default definitions of the EPICS environment variables. This file is
used for creating `envData.c` which is included in the Com library.

`CONFIG_FILE_TYPE`

Definitions to allow user created file types.

`CONFIG_SITE`

File in which you add to or modify make variables in EPICS base. A
definition commonly overridden is `CROSS_COMPILER_TARGET_ARCHS`

`CONFIG_SITE_ENV`

Defaults for site specific definitions of EPICS environment variables.
This file is used for creating `envData.c` which is included in the Com
library.

`CONFIG`

Include statements for all the other configure files. You can override
any definitions in other CONFIG* files by placing override
definitions at the end of this file.

`RELEASE`

Specifies the location of external products such as Tornado II and
external <tops> such as EPICS base.

`RULES`

This file just includes the appropriate rules configuration file.

`RULES.Db`

Rules for building and installing database and database definition
files. Databases generated from templates and/or CapFast schematics
are supported.

`RULES.ioc`

Rules which allow building in the iocBoot/\<iocname\> directory of a makeBaseApp created ioc application.

`RULES_ARCHS`

Definitions and rules which allow building the make target for each target architecture.

`RULES_BUILD`

Build rules for the Makefiles

`RULES_DIRS`

Definitions and rules which allow building the make targets in each
subdirectory. This file is included by Makefiles in directories with
subdirectories to be built.

`RULES_EXPAND`

Definitions and rules to use `expandVars.pl` to expand @VAR@ variables
in a file.

`RULES_FILE_TYPE`

Definitions and rules to allow user created `CONFIG*` and `RULES*` files
and rules to allow user created file types.

`RULES_JAVA` 

Definitions and rules which allow building java class files and java jar files. 

`RULES_TARGET`

Makefile code to create target specific dependency lines for libraries
and product targets.

`RULES_TOP`

Rules specific to a `<top>` level directory e.g. uninstall and tar. It
also includes the `RULES_DIRS` file.

`Makefile` Definitions to allow creation of `CONFIG_APP_INCLUDE` and
installation of the `CONFIG*` files into the `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)`
directory.


### Base configure/os File Descriptions

The configure/os directory contains os specific make definitions. The
naming convention for the files in this directory is
`CONFIG.<host>.<target>` where `<host>` is either the arch for a
specific host system or Common for all supported host systems and
`<target>` is either the arch for a specific target system or Common for
all supported target systems.

For example, the file `CONFIG.Common.vxWorks-pentium` will contain make
definitions to be used for builds on all host systems when building for
a vxWorks-pentium target system.

Also, if a group of host or target files have the same make definitions
these common definitions can be moved to a new file which is then
included in each host or target file. An example of this is all Unix
hosts which have common definitions in a `CONFIG.UnixCommon.Common` file
and all vxWorks targets with definitions in `CONFIG.Common.vxWorksCommon`.

The `base/configure/os` directory contains the following os-arch specific
definitions

`CONFIG.<host>.<target>`

Specific host-target build definitions

`CONFIG.Common.<target>`

Specific target definitions for all hosts

`CONFIG.<host>.Common`

Specific host definitions for all targets

`CONFIG.UnixCommon.Common`

Definitions for Unix hosts and all targets

`CONFIG.<host>.vxWorksCommon`

Specific host definitions for all vx targets

`CONFIG_COMPAT`

R3.13 arch compatibility definitions

`CONFIG_SITE.<host>.<target>`

Site specific host-target definitions

`CONFIG_SITE.Common.<target>`

Site specific target definitions for all hosts

`CONFIG_SITE.<host>.Common`

Site specific host definitions for all targets

### Base src/tools File Descriptions

The src/tools directory contains Perl script tools used for the build. They are
installed by the build into `$(INSTALL_LOCATION)/bin/$(T_A)` for Host type
target archs. The tools currently in this directory are:

convertRelease.pl

:   This Perl script does consistency checks for the external `<top>`
    definitions in the `RELEASE` file. This script also creates `envPaths`,
    `cdCommands`, and `dllPath.bat` files for vxWorks and other IOCs.

cvsclean.pl

:   This perl script finds and deletes cvs .#* files in all directories
    of the directory tree.

dos2unix.pl

:   This perl script converts text file in DOS CR/LF format to unix ISO
    format.

expandVars.pl

:   This perl tool expands @VAR@ variables while copying a file.

filterWarnings.pl

:   This is a perl script that filters compiler warning output (for
    HP-UX).

fullpathname.pl

:   This perl script returns the fullpathname of a file.

installEpics.pl

:   This is a Perl script that installs build created files into the
    install directories.

makeDbDepends.pl

:   This perl script searches .substitutions and .template files for
    entries to create a `DEPENDS` file.

makeIncludeDbd.pl

:   This perl script creates an include dbd file from file names

makeMakefile.pl

:   This is a perl script that creates a Makefile in the created
    `O.<arch>` directories.

makeTestfile.pl

:   This perl script generates a file `$target.t` which executes a real
    test program in the same directory.

mkmf.pl

:   This perl script generates include file dependencies for targets
    from source file include statements.

munch.pl

:   This is a perl script that creates a `ctdt.c` file for vxWorks target
    arch builds which lists the c++ static constructors and destructors.
    See munching in the vxWorks documentation for more information.

replaceVAR.pl

:   This is a perl script that changes VAR(xxx) style macros in CapFast
    generated databases into the `$(xxx)` notation used in EPICS
    databases.

useManifestTool.pl

:   This tools uses MS Visual C++ compiler version number to determine
    if we want to use the Manifest Tool (status=1) or not (status=0).
