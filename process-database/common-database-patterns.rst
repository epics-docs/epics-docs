Pull Alarm Status w/o Data
--------------------------
This is useful to bring alarm status in without affecting the value stored in a record. 
In the following example the alarm status of **$(P):set** is fetched by **$(P):rbv** when it is processed, but the value is read from a different record.

::

    record(bo, "$(P):set") {
        field(OSEV, "MAJOR")
        field(FLNK, "$(P):rbv")
    }

::

    record(bi, "$(P):rbv") {
        field(SDIS, "$(P):set NPP MS")
        field(DISV, "-1")
        field(INP , "$(P):some:other:record")   
    }

Combined Setting and Readback
-----------------------------
Use when a single PV is desired. Could be used to show the results of rounding in a float to fixed precision conversion.

In the following example the value read from a ‘bi’ is inverted so that the associated ‘bo’ acts as a toggle.

::

    record(bi, "$(P):rbv") {
        field(DTYP, "...")
        field(INP , "...")
        field(PINI, "YES")
        field(FLNK, "$(P):inv")
    }

::

    record(calcout, "$(P):inv")
        field(CALC, "!A")
        field(INPA, "$(P):rbv")
        field(OUT , "$(P) NPP")
    }

::

    record(bo, "$(P)") {
        field(DTYP, "...")
        field(OUT , "...")
        field(FLNK, "$(P):rbv")
    }

The important point is the NPP modifier on output link of the ‘calcout’ record. 
This updates the VAL field of the ‘bo’ record (and posts monitors) without processing it.
