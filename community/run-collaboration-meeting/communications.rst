Communications
==============

If possible, start creating a website for the meeting before it is first announced to on tech-talk;
some people will want to be able to find out more about the location when they first hear about it, so the announcement should have a link to that website.

Attendees from some countries such as China may have to navigate a quite long approvals process (internal, government and visa) to be able to attend, and may need a letter of invitation from you to get those approvals.
Provide enough information so they know who to ask well in advance (3-4 months or more is advisable).

Eventually you’ll most probably need online registration of attendees and possibly speakers, as well as to provide information about local hotels, transportation to/from nearby airports, and local tourist agencies for attendees’ partners.
Arranging a “partner programme” is usually unnecessary.
