Facilities
==========

For the main meeting, a hall with LCD projector(s) for computer
connection and a PC to display the presentation files. Most people will
bring talks in MS PowerPoint, Adobe PDF and/or LibreOffice Impress
formats (installing LibreOffice on this machine is advised, but not
essential if you give people notice). It saves time and confusion at
these international meetings if the PC can be configured with English
language settings (Windows menus etc.). Providing a remote control for
the presentation program and a laser pointer is helpful.

Some presenters may want to use their own laptops for live
demonstrations, or if they're using a less common presentation program
(e.g. Apple's Keynote).

In a large hall speakers should use a microphone if a PA is available; a
radio-microphone is preferred.

The main hall (and ideally the other meeting rooms too) should have
reliable, high-bandwidth WiFi internet access since most people will
bring a laptop or notebook PC and want to connect up during the meeting.

Laptop batteries don't last more than a few hours, so there will be
demand for power sockets in the hall too. If these are not available at
every seat, providing extension leads spread about the room is generally
a good idea and is much appreciated by attendees.

Refreshments should be available at the breaks mid-morning and
mid-afternoon. If your institution can't afford to fund these itself it
is acceptable to charge attendees a fee at registration to pay for them
(exhibitors funds are also helpful here). People will expect to pay for
their own lunches, and also to pay to attend the conference dinner which
is usually held on the evening before the last day.
