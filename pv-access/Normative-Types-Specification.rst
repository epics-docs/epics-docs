Abstract
--------

This document defines a set of standard high-level data types to aid
interoperability of peers at the application level of an EPICS V4
network.

The abstract type definition and function of each such standard type is
described. For instance, one such type defined here, named "NTTable",
defines a structure for expressing (in
`pvData <http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/literature.html#pvDataJava>`__)
and communicating (using
`pvAccess <http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/literature.html#pvAccessJava>`__)
a table of numeric or string data.

The data types described here are approximately equivalent to EPICS V3
Database Request types (commonly known as "DBR" types), although
Normative Types extend the concept to structured data and operate at a
higher level in a complex control system, or data exchange, than DBR
types. Also, Normative Types may be used purely for data exchange though
the dynamic data exchange interfaces offered by EPICS pvAccess and
pvData modules, such as pvDatabase or pvAccess RPC servers.

System <http://epics-controls.org>`__.

Status of this Document
-----------------------

This revision of the Normative Types document is a minor modification to
the `16 Mar 2015
version <http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/alpha/normativeTypes/normativeTypes_20150316.html>`__.
This revision adds minor clarifications to the description of NTTable.

The 16 Mar 2015 version updates the definitions of time_t, control_t,
display_t, and alarmLimit_t and changes the order of optional fields in
a number of Normative Types. It replaces NTImage with NTNDArray, adds
NTAttribute, NTMultiChannel, NTUnion and NTScalarMultiChannel and
removes NTVariantArray and a number of types proposed in earlier drafts.

This version contains a number of types which use pvData unions.

It describes the new conventions for Normative Type IDs including
versioning and namespaces. Type IDs for Normative Type structure fields
are given.

The linguistic conventions used in the document have been overhauled.

See `Appendix
A <#appendix-a-possible-future-additions-to-this-specification>`__ for
items that may be added to future revisions of this specification.

This version is an Editors Draft towards the First Public Working Draft.
The First Public Working Draft will be intended for the EPICS community
to review and comment. Resulting comments will drive subsequent
revisions of the Normative Types specification and the EPICS V4 Working
Group's reference implementations of software that helps create,
populate and exchange Normative Type pvData.

Comments are welcome, though bear in mind this is a pre-public release
version.

The terms MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, REQUIRED, and MAY when
highlighted (through style sheets, and in uppercase in the source) are
used in accordance with RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. The term NOT REQUIRED (not
defined in RFC 2119) indicates exemption.

Introduction
------------

The Normative Types described in this document are a set of software
designs for high-level `composite data
types <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type#Composite_types>`__
suitable for the application-level data exchange between EPICS network
endpoints using the pvAccess protocol. In particular, they are intended
for use in online scientific data services. The intention is that where
the endpoints in an EPICS network use only Normative Types, each peer in
the network should be able to understand all the data transmitted to it,
at least syntactically, and be able to take processing steps appropriate
to that data.

We call these types the
`Normative <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normative#Standards_documents>`__
Types, to emphasize their role as the prescriptions of abstract data
structures, whose role and intended semantics are described in this
document, as opposed to implemented software; and that conformance to
these semantics is a necessary condition for interoperability of using
systems.

The EPICS (7) module
`pvData <https://github.com/epics-base/pvDataCPP>`__
`bib:pvdata <#bib:pvdata>`__ supplies a typing mechanism and object
management API for efficiently defining, creating, accessing and
updating memory resident structured data. EPICS module
`pvAccess <https://github.com/epics-base/pvAccessCPP>`__
`bib:pvaccess <#bib:pvaccess>`__ supports the efficient exchange of
pvData defined data between EPICS V4 network peers. The EPICS V4
Normative Types specification defines some general purpose data types
that build on pvData. These are designed to be generally applicable to
the process control, and the software applications level, of scientific
instruments.

A simple example of a Normative Type described in this document is the
one for exchanging any single scalar value, such as one floating point
number, one integer or one string. That Normative Type is named
"NTScalar". When a client receives a pvData datum which identifies
itself as being of type NTScalar, the client will know to expect that
the structure which carries the NTScalar will include the scalar value
in question (along with its type), and that value may be accompanied by
up to 5 additional fields: a description of the quality in question, a
timestamp, an indication of alarm severity, fields that help in how to
display the value, and data about its operating limits. See the example
below.

An example of a simple Normative Type is the NTScalar:

::

   NTScalar :=

   structure
       scalar_t    value
       string      descriptor  :opt
       alarm_t     alarm       :opt
       time_t      timeStamp   :opt
       display_t   display     :opt
       control_t   control     :opt

A more complex example: If a client receives a pvData datum which
identifies itself as being of type NTTable, this document specifies that
it should expect the datum to contain 0 or more arrays of potentially
different types. The description of NTTable in this document will say
that the client should interpret the arrays as the columns of a table,
and should render such a datum appropriately as a table, with row
elements being taken from the same numbered elements of each array.

::

   NTTable :=

   structure
     string[]    labels           // The field names of each field in value
     structure   value
        {scalar_t[] colname}0+  // 0 or more scalar array type
                                  // instances, the column values.
     string      descriptor    : opt
     alarm_t     alarm         : opt
     time_t      timeStamp     : opt

Description of Normative Types
------------------------------

All the EPICS V4 Normative Types are defined as particular structure
instance definitions of a pvData
`structure <http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/docbuild/pvDataJava/tip/documentation/pvDataJava.html#metalang_structure>`__.
This is true even of the Normative Types describing simple values like a
single int, since all Normative Types optionally include descriptor,
alarm and timestamp. The fields of any given Ntype datum instance can be
ascertained at runtime using the `pvData Field introspection
interface <http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/docbuild/pvDataJava/tip/documentation/pvDataJava.html#introspection_interfaces>`__
`bib:pvdata <#bib:pvdata>`__.

See the `Normative Type instance
self-identification <#normative-type-instance-self--identification>`__
section below for more on how to examine a given pvData instance to see
which fields it includes. That section also includes how to mark a
pvData instance as a Normative Type, and how to look for that mark.

**Definition**: Normative Type

The Normative Types definitions in this document each have the following
general form:

1. They are defined as structures, composed of fields.
2. They usually have one primary field called "value", which encodes the
   most important data of the type.
3. They are composed of required fields, and optional fields. The
   required fields come first, the optional fields follow.
4. The order of fields matters. Although the Normative Types pvData
   binding allows for access though an `introspection
   API <http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/docbuild/pvDataJava/tip/documentation/pvDataJava.html#introspection_interfaces>`__,
   senders must encode the fields in the order described in this
   document.

Linguistic conventions used in this document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Normative Type can be used both for sending data from client to
service and from service to client. In this document we refer generally
to an *agent*, being either a client or a server. If the agent is
specifically at the user's end, we call it the *user agent*. *Client*
and *server* refer to the directionality of the transaction, server
being the agent that is doing the sending.

The word "Ntype" is used as a short form of "Normative Type".

The Normative Type data descriptions are given with the syntactic
conventions and grammar given below. The types are described in a
BNF-like syntax in order to add clear distinctions between symbol types,
particularly terminality, recurrence, which names a user is expected to
add and which are predefined. This syntax is essentially Extended
Backus-Naur Form (EBNF), with some slight modifications to preserve the
order of terms and the rules for line ends and indentation.

The syntactic conventions are as follows.

First, the conventions for terminal and non-terminal types are:

-  *italics* - a non-terminal. These are used to stand for a choice of
   pvData type, or named sequence of fields, or for a specific structure
   or union, and hence non-terminal.
-  ``plaintext`` - terminals. These will be either a pvData Meta
   Language keyword or a label. The Meta language keywords consist of
   ``structure``, ``union``, ``any``, the scalar type keywords
   (``boolean``, ``byte``, ``short``, ``int``, ``long``, ``double``,
   ``ubyte``, ``ushort``, ``uint``, ``ulong``, ``float``, ``double`` and
   ``string``) and the corresponding arrays ``structure[]``,
   ``union[]``, ``any[]``, and scalar arrays (e.g. ``int[]``,
   ``double[]]``).
-  <name> - A user-provided label name.A programmer using the Normative
   Type will choose what goes in the <>.

So, for example, `scalar_t <#scalar_t>`__ is non-terminal as it stands
for a choice of pvData type and `time_t <#time_t>`__ is non-terminal
because it stands for a particular structure. On the other hand, in the
definition of *time_t*, ``long`` and ``secondsPastEpoch`` are a keyword
and a label respectively, and so are terminal, and the columns of
`NTTable <#nttable>`__, <colname>, are user-provided labels.

In this section <> will also be used for describing patterns of
definitions or meta rules such as production rules of the grammar to
indicate a choice of terminal or non-terminal terms in the pattern or
rule.

The EBNF-like syntax for definitions is used. A description consists of
3 terms - a left-hand side (LHS), a right-hand side (RHS), and the
symbol ":=" separating them, which is to be interpreted as "LHS is
defined as RHS". The LHS will be the non-terminal being defined. The RHS
will be a sequence of terminal or non-terminal terms.

Note that in the definitions below line-ends (EOLs) are not explicitly
specified. They are implied except when multiple lines are used to
specify alternatives separated by \|, where only the final EOL is
implied.

The following EBNF symbols are also used:

-  \| - used to separate alternative items; one item is chosen from this
   list of alternatives.
-  [] - optional items are enclosed between square brackets [ and ]; the
   item can either be included or discarded. Note, optional fields of
   structures are marked as such by the use of ``:opt`` instead of
   square brackets.
-  { } - a sequence of occurrences of the item or items in the braces.
   The number of occurrences follows. 0+ means 0 or more. 1+ means 1 or
   more.

The following production rules are employed:

1. Replace a non-terminal by its definition, except where the
   non-terminal defines a structure or union and is followed by a field
   name. (The modified rule for non-terminal structures and unions is
   described below.)
2. Choose an alternative for items separated by \|.
3. Choose a user supplied label for items between angle brackets (< and
   >).
4. Include or discard items between square brackets ([ and ]). Note this
   excludes a pair of square brackets ([]) used to signify an array.
5. Include or discard fields marked ``:opt``.
6. For items between braces ({ and }) replace with an appropriate number
   of occurrences of the item. For a sequence of pvData fields a
   line-end (EOL) is implied after each one.

In the case of structure and union fields, to preserve the order of
terms in the pvData Meta language, as well as obtaining appropriate
indentation, the usual EBNF rule of replacing a non-terminal by its
definition requires the following modification:

Suppose a non-terminal term has a definition of the form

::

   <non-terminal>:=

   structure
       fieldList

where:

<*non-terminal*>
   The non-terminal term being defined.

<fieldName>

   A choice of terminal or non-terminal terms describing a list of 0
   or more pvData fields.

Then for a label (a field name), <fieldName>, the terms

::

   <non-terminal> <fieldName>

are replaced by

::

   structure <fieldName>
       <fieldList>

The result of the any substitution is suitably indented to preserve the
logic of the pvData meta language.

Thus the structure derived from the definition of `NTEnum <#ntenum>`__
below, with all optional fields present, is

::

   structure
       structure  value
           int      index
           string[] choices
       string     descriptor
       structure  timeStamp
           long     secondsPastEpoch
           int      nanoseconds
           int      userTag
       structure   alarm
           int      severity
           int      status
           string   message

The same rule also applies with ``union`` in place of ``structure``.

The grammar for a Normative Type definition follows the pattern below.
That is, a Normative Type is defined as a structure composed of fields.
A field may be optional, and may be described along with a comment:

::

   <NormativeType>:=

   structure
      { <pvDataField> [:opt] [// <commentText>] }1+

where:

<*NormativeType*>
   The name of the Normative Type being defined.

<pvDataField>
   A choice of terms defining a pvData field

:opt
   Indicates that the preceding field is optional in the Normative Type.

// <commentText>
   A field production element may be followed by a comment.

In most cases a Normative Type definition will be of the form

::

   <NTname>:=

   structure
      { ntfieldChoice fieldName [:opt] [// commentText] }1+

where:

<ntFieldChoice>
   Terminal or non-terminal terms, possibly separated by \|, from the
   valid `Normative Type Fields <#normative-type-fields>`__ as defined
   below.

<fieldName>
   The identifier of the field. Usually a terminal label.

For example, a definition meeting this pattern would be

::

   NTExample :=

   structure
       enum_t | scalar_t   value
       int                 N                  // this field has a comment
       string              descriptor  :opt
       alarm_t             alarm       :opt
       time_t              timeStamp   :opt

Normative Type Fields
---------------------

This section defines the fields that may appear in a Normative Type's
definition.

Each field of a Normative Type will typically be one of the following:

::

   ntfield :=

     scalar_t        // a simple numerical, boolean, or string value
   | scalar_t[]      // an array of simple values
   | enum_t          // an enumeration
   | enum_t[]        // an array of enumerations
   | time_t          // a point in time, used for timestamps
   | time_t[]        // an array of points in time
   | alarm_t         // a summary diagnostic of a control system event
   | alarm_t[]       // an array of summary diagnostics
   | alarmLimit_t    // value thresholds for a control system diagnostic report
   | alarmLimit_t[]  // an array of threshold values
   | display_t       // metadata of displayed data
   | display_t[]     // an array of display metadata
   | control_t       // control setpoint range boundaries
   | control_t[]     // an array of control setpoint range boundaries
   | any             // a variant union type
   | any[]           // an array of variant unions fields
   | ntunion_t       // a regular union storing ntfields only
   | ntunion_t[]     // a regular union array storing ntfields only
   | union_t         // any regular union
   | union_t[]       // any regular union array
   | anyunion_t      // any variant or regular union
   | anyunion_t[]    // any variant or regular union array

although some examples may have fields of other types.

Simple Normative Type fields - scalar and scalar array types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that of all the Normative Type fields only *scalar_t* and
*scalar_t[]* are of simple type, that is, having a single scalar or
scalar array value of a fixed type. All the others are represented by a
complex type, i.e. a structure or union or arrays of structures or
unions (see `Structured Normative Type
fields <#structured-normative-type-fields>`__ and `Union Normative Type
fields <#union-normative-type-fields>`__ below).

scalar_t
^^^^^^^^

The field is a scalar value. Scalar fields would be implemented with
pvData field Type
`"scalar" <http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/docbuild/pvDataJava/tip/documentation/pvDataJava.html#metalang_scalar>`__:

::

   scalar_t :=

      boolean  // true or false
   |  byte     // 8 bit signed integer
   |  ubyte    // 8 bit unsigned integer
   |  short    // 16 bit signed integer
   |  ushort   // 16 bit unsigned integer
   |  int      // 32 bit signed integer
   |  uint     // 32 bit unsigned integer
   |  long     // 64 bit signed integer
   |  ulong    // 64 bit unsigned integer
   |  float    // single precision IEEE 754
   |  double   // double precision IEEE 754
   |  string   // UTF-8 *

.. _scalar_t-1:

scalar_t[]
^^^^^^^^^^

The field is an array of scalars. Scalar array fields would be
implemented with a pvData field of type
`"scalarArray" <http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/docbuild/pvDataJava/tip/documentation/pvDataJava.html#metalang_scalar_array>`__:

::

   scalar_t[] :=

      boolean[]  // array of true or false
   |  byte[]     // array of 8 bit signed integer
   |  ubyte[]    // array of 8 bit unsigned integer
   |  short[]    // array of 16 bit signed integer
   |  ushort[]   // array of 16 bit unsigned integer
   |  int[]      // array of 32 bit signed integer
   |  uint[]     // array of 32 bit unsigned integer
   |  long[]     // array of 64 bit signed integer
   |  ulong[]    // array of 64 bit unsigned integer
   |  float[]    // array of single precision IEEE 754
   |  double[]   // array of double precision IEEE 754
   |  string[]   // array of UTF-8 *

Structured Normative Type fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This subsection defines those fields of a Normative Type structure
definition that are themselves structures or arrays of structures.

The structured Normative Type fields would be implemented with type
pvData field type
`"structure" <http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/docbuild/pvDataJava/tip/documentation/pvDataJava.html#metalang_structure>`__
or
`"structureArray" <http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/docbuild/pvDataJava/tip/documentation/pvDataJava.html#metalang_structure_array>`__.

enum_t
^^^^^^

An *enum_t* describes an enumeration. The field is a structure
describing a value drawn from a given set of valid values also given. It
is implemented as a pvData Field of type
`"structure" <http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/docbuild/pvDataJava/tip/documentation/pvDataJava.html#metalang_structure>`__
of type ID "enum_t" with the following form:

::

   enum_t :=

   structure
       int index
       string[] choices

where:

index
   The index of the current value of the enumeration in the array
   choices below.
choices
   An array of strings specifying the set of labels for the valid values
   of the enumeration.

.. _enum_t-1:

enum_t[]
^^^^^^^^

An *enum_t[]* describes an array of enumerations. The field is an array
of structures each describing a value drawn from a given set of valid
values also given in each. It is implemented as a pvData field of type
`"structureArray" <http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/docbuild/pvDataJava/tip/documentation/pvDataJava.html#metalang_structure_array>`__,
each element of which is a structure of the form *enum_t* above.

time_t
^^^^^^

A *time_t]* describes a defined point in time. The field is a structure
describing a time relative to midnight on January 1st, 1970 UTC. It is
implemented as a pvData field of type
`"structure" <http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/docbuild/pvDataJava/tip/documentation/pvDataJava.html#metalang_structure>`__
of type ID "time_t" and with the following form:

::

   time_t :=

   structure
       long secondsPastEpoch
       int  nanoseconds
       int  userTag

where:

secondsPastEpoch
   Seconds since Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.
nanoseconds
   Nanoseconds relative to the ``secondsPastEpoch`` field.
userTag
   An integer value whose interpretation is deliberately undefined and
   therefore MAY be used by EPICS V4 agents in a user defined way.

Interpretation: The point in time being identified by a *time_t*, is
given by Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC plus some nanoseconds given by its
``secondsPastEpoch`` times 10\ :sup:`9` plus its ``nanoseconds``.

.. _time_t-1:

time_t[]
^^^^^^^^

A *time_t[]* describes an array of points in time. The field is an array
of structures each describing a time relative to January 1st, 1970 UTC.
It is implemented as a pvData field of type
`"structureArray" <http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/docbuild/pvDataJava/tip/documentation/pvDataJava.html#metalang_structure_array>`__,
each element of which is a structure of the form *time_t* above.

alarm_t
^^^^^^^

An *alarm_t* describes a diagnostic of the value of a control system
process variable. It indicates essentially whether the associated value
is good or bad, and whether agent systems should alert people to the
status of the process.

Processes in EPICS V3 and V4 IOCs include extensive support for
evaluating alarm conditions. The definition of the fields in an
``alarm`` are given in `bib:epicsrecref <#bib:epicsrecref>`__. The field
is a structure describing an alarm. It is implemented as a pvData field
of type
`"structure" <http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/docbuild/pvDataJava/tip/documentation/pvDataJava.html#metalang_structure>`__
of type ID "alarm_t" with the following form:

::

   alarm_t :=

   structure
       int severity
       int status
       string message

where:

severity
   severity is defined as an int (not an *enum_t*), but MUST be
   functionally interpreted as the enumeration {noAlarm, minorAlarm,
   majorAlarm, invalidAlarm, undefinedAlarm } indexed from noAlarm=0
   `bib:epicsrecref <#bib:epicsrecref>`__.
status
   status is defined as an int (not an *enum_t*), but MUST be
   functionally interpreted as the enumeration {noStatus, deviceStatus,
   driverStatus, recordStatus, dbStatus, confStatus, undefinedStatus,
   clientStatus } indexed from noStatus=0
   `bib:epicsrecref <#bib:epicsrecref>`__.
message
   A message string.

Interpretation MUST be as with V3 IOC record processing, as described in
the EPICS Reference Manual `bib:epicsrecref <#bib:epicsrecref>`__.

.. _alarm_t-1:

alarm_t[]
^^^^^^^^^

An *alarm_t[]* is an array of alarm conditions. The field is an array of
structures each describing an alarm condition. It is implemented as a
pvData field of type
`"structureArray" <http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/docbuild/pvDataJava/tip/documentation/pvDataJava.html#metalang_structure_array>`__,
each element of which is a structure of the form *alarm_t* above.

alarmLimit_t
^^^^^^^^^^^^

An *alarmLimit_t* is a structure that gives the numeric intervals to be
used for the high and low limit ranges of an associated value field. The
specific value to which the alarmLimit refers, is not specified in the
alarmLimit structure. It is usually a value field of type double that
appears in the same structure as the alarmLimit. *alarmLimit_t* is
implemented as a pvData field of type
`"structure" <http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/docbuild/pvDataJava/tip/documentation/pvDataJava.html#metalang_structure>`__
of type ID "alarmLimit_t" with the following form:

::

   alarmLimit_t :=

   structure
       boolean active
       double lowAlarmLimit
       double lowWarningLimit
       double highWarningLimit
       double highAlarmLimit
       int lowAlarmSeverity
       int lowWarningSeverity
       int highWarningSeverity
       int highAlarmSeverity
       double hysteresis

where:

active
   Is alarming active? If no then alarms are not raised. If yes then the
   associated value is checked for alarm conditions.
lowAlarmLimit
   If the value is <= lowAlarmLimit then the severity is
   lowAlarmSeverity.
lowWarningLimit
   If the value is > lowAlarmLimit and <= lowWarningLimit then the
   severity is lowWarningSeverity.
highWarningLimit
   If the value is >= highWarningLimit and < highAlarmLimit then the
   severity is highWarningLimit.
highAlarmLimit
   If the value is >= highAlarmLimit then the severity is
   highAlarmSeverity.
lowAlarmSeverity
   Severity for value that satisfies lowAlarmLimit.
lowWarningSeverity
   Severity for value that satisfies lowWarningLimit.
highWarningSeverity
   Severity for value that satisfies highWarningLimit.
highAlarmSeverity
   Severity for value that satisfies highAlarmLimit.
hysteresis
   When a value enters an alarm limit this is how much it must change
   before is it put into a lower severity state. This prevents alarm
   chatter.

Code that checks for alarms should use code similar to the following:

::

       boolean active = pvActive.get();
       if(!active) return;
       double  val = pvValue.get();
       int severity = pvHighAlarmSeverity.get();
       double level = pvHighAlarmLimit.get();
       if(severity>0 && (val>=level)) {
           raiseAlarm(level,val,severity,"highAlarm");
           return;
       }
       severity = pvLowAlarmSeverity.get();
       level = pvLowAlarmLimit.get();
       if(severity>0 && (val<=level)) {
           raiseAlarm(level,val,severity,"lowAlarm");
           return;
       }
       severity = pvHighWarningSeverity.get();
       level = pvHighWarningLimit.get();
       if(severity>0 && (val>=level)) {
           raiseAlarm(level,val,severity,"highWarning");
           return;
       }
       severity = pvLowWarningSeverity.get();
       level = pvLowWarningLimit.get();
       if(severity>0 && (val<=level)) {
           raiseAlarm(level,val,severity,"lowWarning");
           return;
       }
       raiseAlarm(0,val,0,"");

**NOTE:** The current pvData implementations have a structure named
**valueAlarm_t** instead of **alarmLimit_t**. *valueAlarm_t* is similar
to *alarmLimit_t*, except that the former's alarm limit fields
(``lowAlarmLimit``, ``lowWarningLimit``, ``highWarningLimit`` and
``highAlarmLimit``) can be any integer or floating point scalar type
(the same type for all the limit fields in each case), rather than only
double. There is also a separate form for alarm limits for boolean
values. *alarmLimit_t* is identical to the *valueAlarm_t* for type
double, except that the type ID of *valueAlarm_t* is "valueAlarm_t").
Normative types only defines alarmLimit since this is what clients like
plot tools use.

.. _alarmlimit_t-1:

alarmLimit_t[]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An *alarmLimit_t[]* is an array of alarm limit conditions. The field is
an array of structures each describing an alarm limit. It is implemented
as a pvData field of type
`"structureArray" <http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/docbuild/pvDataJava/tip/documentation/pvDataJava.html#metalang_structure_array>`__,
each element of which is a structure of the form *alarmLimit_t* above.

display_t
^^^^^^^^^

A *display_t* is a structure that describes some typical attributes of a
numerical value that are of interest when displaying the value on a
computer screen or similar medium. The ``units`` field SHOULD contain a
string representation of the physical units for the value, if any. The
``description`` field SHOULD contain a short (one-line) description of
what the value represents, such as can be used as a label in a display.
The fields ``limitLow`` and ``limitHigh`` represent the range in between
which the value should be presented as adjustable.

The field is a structure describing a *display_t*. It is implemented as
a pvData field of type
`"structure" <http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/docbuild/pvDataJava/tip/documentation/pvDataJava.html#metalang_structure>`__
of type ID "display_t" with the following form:

::

   display_t :=

   structure
       double limitLow
       double limitHigh
       string description
       string units
       int precision
       enum_t form(3)
           int index
           string[] choices ["Default", "String", "Binary", "Decimal", "Hex", "Exponential", "Engineering"]

where:

limitLow
   The lower bound of range within which the value must be set, to be
   presented to a user.
limitHigh
   The upper bound of range within which the value must be set, to be
   presented to a user.
description
   A textual summary of the variable that the value quantifies.
precision
   Number of decimal points that are displayed when formatting a
   floating point number. This corresponds to the PREC field in EPICS
   database records with floating point values (e.g., ai, ao, calc,
   calcout record types.)
form
   An enumeration to specify formatting a value to be displayed. By
   default, a floating point number is formatted with the number of
   decimal points defined in the precision field. Formatting of an EPICS
   database record value can be configured by including eg. info(Q:form,
   “Hex”) in record definition.
units
   The units for the value field.

Where an *display_t* structure instance is present in a Normative Type
structure, it MUST be interpreted as referring to that Normative Type's
field named "value". Therefore it is only used in Normative Types that
have a single numeric "value" field.

.. _display_t-1:

display_t[]
^^^^^^^^^^^

A *display_t[]* is an array of *display_t*. The field is an array of
structures each describing the display media oriented metadata of some
corresponding process variable value, as described by *display_t* above.
It is implemented as a pvData field of type
`"structureArray" <http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/docbuild/pvDataJava/tip/documentation/pvDataJava.html#metalang_structure_array>`__,
each element of which is a structure of the form *display_t* above.

control_t
^^^^^^^^^

A *control_t* is a structure that describes a range, given by the
interval (limitLow,limitHigh), within which it is expected some control
software or hardware shall bind the control PV to which this Normative
Type instance's value field refers as well as a minimum step change of
the control PV.

The field is a structure describing a *control_t*. It is implemented as
a pvData field of type
`"structure" <http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/docbuild/pvDataJava/tip/documentation/pvDataJava.html#metalang_structure>`__
of type ID "control_t" with the following form:

::

   control_t :=

   structure
       double limitLow
       double limitHigh
       double minStep

where:

lowLimit
   The control low limit for the value field.
highLimit
   The control high limit for the value field.
minStep
   The minimum step change for the value field.

.. _control_t-1:

control_t[]
^^^^^^^^^^^

A *control_t[]* is an array of *control_t*. The field is an array of
structures each describing the setpoint range interval of some process
variable. It is implemented as a pvData field of type
`"structureArray" <http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/docbuild/pvDataJava/tip/documentation/pvDataJava.html#metalang_structure_array>`__,
each element of which is a structure of the form *control_t* above.

*anyunion_t* above:

::

   anyunion_t[]:=

Normative Type Metadata
-----------------------

Metadata are included in runtime instances of Normative Types. The
metadata includes to which Normative Type the structure instance
conforms, version information, and other data to aid efficient
processing, diagnostics and displays.

Normative Type instance self-identification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Normative Type instance data MUST identify themselves as such by
including an identifying string. That is the Normative Type Identifier,
or "Ntype Identifier" string for short. In the pvData binding of
Normative Types, this string is carried in the type ID, added
automatically to every pvData structure.

A Normative Type Identifier MUST be considered to be "case sensitive."

The namespace Name of EPICS Normative Types (which is used as the prefix
for their pvData type ID), is the following:

::

        epics:nt

The normative list of the Normative Type Identifiers corresponding to
`this draft <#thisversion>`__ of the EPICS V4 Normative Types
specification document (this document), is given in `Appendix
B <#normative-ntype-list>`__

As an example, one of the simplest Normative Types is
`NTScalar <#ntscalar>`__. It has formal Type Name "NTScalar". Therefore,
the Normative Type Identifier for an NTScalar, is presently
epics:nt/NTScalar:1.0.

At present it is envisaged that the same namespace value shall be used
for all versions of this document prior to
`Recommendation <http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/epicsv4process.html#normative_document_development_and_publication_process>`__,
including all Public Working Drafts of this document and those marked
Last Call or similar.

pvAccess binding type identification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the EPICS v4 pvData/pvAccess binding, the structure identification
string (ID) of pvData structures is used to communicate the Normative
Type of the datum carried by the pvData structure. Every pvData datum
which is intended to conform to a Normative Type, MUST identify the
Normative Type to which it conforms through its type ID. Its ID MUST
have the value of its Normative Type Identifier. For instance, a pvData
structure conforming to NTScalar, must have ID equal to
"epics:nt/NTScalar:1.0". Every EPICS V4 agent which is encoding or
decoding pvData data that is described by Normative Types, SHOULD
examine the ID of such data, to establish the Normative Type to which
each datum conforms.

Example pvAccess/pvData binding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Recall that in the pvData system, data variables are constructed in two
equally important parts; the `introspection
interface <http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/docbuild/pvDataJava/tip/documentation/pvDataJava.html#introspection_interfaces>`__,
in which data types are defined, and the `data
interface <http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/docbuild/pvDataJava/tip/documentation/pvDataJava.html#data_interfaces>`__,
in which instance variables are created and populated. The introspection
interface can be used to examine an existing instance, to see what
fields it possesses. Getting and setting values, is done through the
data interface. As a programmer, you have to define both parts, the
introspection interface of your type, and its data interface. Both the
data and the introspection interfaces are exchanged by pvAccess. That
is, when a sender constructs a data type, such as one conforming to an
Normative Type, plus an instance of that type, and it sends the instance
to a receiver, the receiver can check that the instance indeed contains
the member fields it should find for that type, using the type's
introspection interface.

The following Java code snippets give an example of the use of a pvData
structure of Normative Type `NTScalar <#ntscalar>`__, as defined below.
in this example we show code as may be included in a trivial
"multiplier" service, and a client of the multiplier service.

Sender
''''''

The sender typically first creates an introspection definition, using
the pvData introspection interfaces (Field, Structure etc.). It then
creates an instance of the type and populates it with the pvData data
interfaces (PVField, PVStructure etc.).

Example of creating the introspection interface of an NTScalar, as may
be done on a server that will be returning one. In this example, only
one of the optional fields of NTScalar, named "descriptor" is included,
along with the required field named "value".

::

      // Create the data type definition, using the pvData introspection interface (Structure etc.).
      FieldCreate fieldCreate = FieldFactory.getFieldCreate();
      Structure resultStructure = fieldCreate.createStructure( "epics:nt/NTScalar:1.0",
          new String[] { "value", "descriptor" },
          new Field[] { fieldCreate.createScalar(ScalarType.pvDouble),
                        fieldCreate.createScalar(ScalarType.pvString) } );

Subsequently, the sender would create an instance of the type, and
populate it.

Example of creating an instance and data interface of an NTScalar, as
may be done on a data server, and populating it.

::

      // If a and b were arguments to this service, the following creates an instance of
      // a resultStructure, which conforms to the NTScalar Normative Type definition,
      // and populates it. It would then return this PVStructure instance.
      PVStructure result = PVDataFactory.getPVDataCreate().createPVStructure(resultStructure);
      result.getDoubleField("value").put(a * b);
      result.getStringField("descriptor").put("The product of arguments a and b");

The PVStructure instance, in the example called "result" would be
returned to the receiver.

Receiver
''''''''

Having in some way done a pvAccess get, the receiver could simply
extract the primary value:

::

      PVStructure result = easyPVA.createChannel("multiplierService").createRPC().request(request);
      double product = result.getDoubleField("value").get();

A well written receiver would check that the introspection interface
(Structure etc.) says that the received instance is indeed of the type
it expects. It may extract the data fields individually, checking their
type. Importantly, it can also see which optional fields it received,
before attempting to access them. Here is a more complete receiver
example for the NTScalar sent above. This code might be in the client
side of the Multiplier service.

Example of a receiver of an NTScalar. The example checks that the
returned pvData datum was an instance of an NTScalar, extracts the
required value field, and then, if it's present, extracts the optional
"descriptor" field.

::

      // Call the multiplier service sending the request in a structure
      PVStructure result = easyPVA.createChannel("multiplierService").createRPC().request(request);

      // Examine the returned structure via its introspection interface, to check whether its
      // identifier says that it is a Normative Type, and the type we expected.
      if (!result.getStructure().getID().equals("epics:nt/NTScalar:1.0"))
      {
          System.err.println("Unexpected data identifier returned from multiplierService: " +
             "Expected Normative Type ID epics:nt/NTScalar:1.0, but got "
             + result.getStructure().getID());
          System.exit(-1);
      }

      // Get and print the required value member field as a Double.
      System.out.println( "value = " + result.getDoubleField("value").get());

      // See if there was also the descriptor subField, and if so, get it and print it.
      PVString descriptorpv = (PVString)result.getSubField("descriptor");
      if ( descriptorpv != null)
         System.out.println( "descriptor = " + descriptorpv.get());

      // Or just print everything we got:
      System.out.println("\nWhole result structure toString =\n" + result);

Future of type identification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In future drafts of this specification, a pattern to create extensions
to the EPICS V4 Normative Types may be presented. It may be based on a
formalized link to the XML namespace and XML Schema system, whereby the
namespace part of the Normative Type Identifier of a datum whose type is
an extension of one of these Normative Types, is replaced by another
namespace that extends this one through an XML Schema out of band. In
that case, the type name part would identify a type in that other
namespace, though it may extend a type in this namespace.

Standard optional metadata fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All of the Normative Types defined below, optionally include a
descriptor, alarm and timestamp. There is no required interpretation of
these fields, and therefore their meaning is not further described in
the Normative Type definitions. Additionally, Normative Types may have
other optional fields, as defined individually below.

Optional descriptor field
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An object of Normative Type may optionally include a field named
"descriptor" and of type string, to be used to give identity, name, or
sense information. For instance, it may be valued with the name of a
device associated with control data, or the run number of a table of
model data.

::

   string descriptor  :opt     // Contextual information

Optional alarm field
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An object of Normative Type may optionally include an alarm field.

::

   alarm_t alarm      :opt     // Control system event summary

Optional timeStamp field
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An object of Normative Type may optionally include a timeStamp field.

::

   time_t timeStamp   :opt     // Event time

General Normative Types
-----------------------

The General Normative Types are for encapsulating data of any kind of
application or use case. Compare to `Specific Normative
Types <#specific-normative-types>`__, defined later in this document,
which are oriented to particular use cases.

NTScalar
~~~~~~~~

NTScalar is the EPICS V4 Normative Type that describes a single scalar
value plus metadata:

::

   NTScalar :=

   structure
       scalar_t    value
       string      descriptor  :opt
       alarm_t     alarm       :opt
       time_t      timeStamp   :opt
       display_t   display     :opt
       control_t   control     :opt

where:

value
   The primary data carried by the NTScalar object. The field must be
   named "value" and can be of any simple scalar type as defined above.

NTScalarArray
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NTScalarArray is the EPICS V4 Normative Type that describes an array of
values, plus metadata. All the elements of the array of the same scalar
type.

::

   NTScalarArray :=

   structure
       scalar_t[]  value
       string      descriptor  :opt
       alarm_t     alarm       :opt
       time_t      timeStamp   :opt
       display_t   display     :opt
       control_t   control     :opt

where:

value
   The primary data carried by the NTScalarArray object. The field must
   be named "value" and can be of any scalar array type as defined
   above.

NTEnum
~~~~~~

NTEnum is an EPICS V4 Normative Type that describes an enumeration (a
closed set of possible values each described by an n-tuple).

::

   NTEnum :=

   structure
       enum_t      value
       string      descriptor  :opt
       alarm_t     alarm       :opt
       time_t      timeStamp   :opt


where:

value
   The primary data carried by the NTEnum object. The field must be
   named "value" and must be an enumeration as defined above.

NTMatrix
~~~~~~~~

NTMatrix is an EPICS V4 Normative Type used to define a matrix,
specifically a 2-dimensional array of real numbers.

::

   NTMatrix :=

   structure
       double[]    value
       int[2]      dim         :opt
       string      descriptor  :opt
       alarm_t     alarm       :opt
       time_t      timeStamp   :opt
       display_t   display     :opt

where:

value
   The numerical data comprising the matrix. The value is given as a
   single array of doubles. When ``value`` holds the data of a matrix,
   rather than a vector, then the data MUST be laid out in "row major
   order"; that is, all the elements of the first row, then all the
   elements of the second row, and so on. For instance, where NTMatrix
   represented a 6x6 matrix, element (1,2) of the matrix would be in the
   2nd element of ``value``, and element (3,4) would be in the 16th
   element.
dim
   ``dim`` indicates the dimensions of the matrix. If ``dim`` is not
   present, ``value`` MUST be interpreted as a vector, of length equal
   to the number of elements of ``value``. If ``dim`` is present, then
   it must have 1 or 2 elements; its one element value or both elements
   values MUST be > 0, and the number of elements in ``value`` MUST be
   equal to the product of the elements of ``dim``. If ``dim`` is
   present and contains a single element, then the NTMatrix MUST be
   interpreted as describing a vector. A ``dim]`` of 2 elements
   describes a matrix, where the first element of ``dim`` gives the
   number of rows, and the second element of ``dim`` gives the number
   columns. If ``dim`` is present and contains 2 elements, of which the
   first is unity, and the second is not (therefore is >1) then the
   NTMatrix MUST be interpreted as describing a row vector. If ``dim``
   is present as contains 2 elements, of which the second is unity, and
   the first is not (therefore is >1) then the NTMatrix MUST be
   interpreted as describing a column vector.

User agents that print or otherwise render an NTMatrix SHOULD print row
vector, column vector, and non-vector matrices appropriately.

NTURI
~~~~~

NTURI is the EPICS V4 Normative Type that describes a Uniform Resource
Identifier (URI) `bib:uri <#bib:uri>`__. Specifically, NTURI carries the
four parts of a "Generic URI", as described in `bib:uri <#bib:uri>`__ as
the subset of URI that share a common syntax for representing
hierarchical relationships within the namespace. As such, NTURI is
intended to be able to encode any generic URI scheme's data. However,
NTURI's primary purpose in the context of EPICS, is to offer a well
formed and standard compliant way that EPICS agents can make a request
for an identified resource from a channel, especially an EPICS V4 RPC
channel. See
`ChannelRPC <http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/docbuild/pvAccessJava/tip/documentation/pvAccessJava.html#channelrpc>`__.

The "pva" scheme is introduced here for EPICS V4 interactions. The pva
scheme implies but does not require use of the pvAccess protocol. A
scheme description for Channel Access (implying the ca protocol) will be
added later. What follows is a description of the syntax and semantics
for the pva scheme.

::

   NTURI  :=

   structure
       string scheme
       string authority   : opt
       string path
       structure query    : opt
           {string | double | int <field-name>}0+
       {<field-type> <field-name>}0+

Interpretation of NTURI under the "pva" scheme
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following describes how the fields of the NTURI must be interpreted
when the scheme is "pva":

scheme
   The scheme name must be given. For the pva scheme, the scheme name is
   "pva". The pva scheme implies but does not require use of the
   pvAccess protocol.
authority
   If given, then the IP name or address of an EPICS network pvAccess or
   channel access server.
path
   The path gives the channel from which data is being requested.
query
   A name value system for passing parameters. The types of the argument
   value MUST be drawn from the following restricted set of scalar
   types: double, int, or string.
<field-type>
   Zero or more pvData Fields whose type are not defined until runtime,
   may be added to an NTURI by an agent creating an NTURI. This is the
   mechanism by which complex data may be sent to a channel. For
   instance a table of magnet setpoints.

The channel name given in the path MAY BE the name of an RPC channel. In
that case, it's important to note that this specification makes no
normative statement about where in the NTURI is encoded the name of the
entity *about which* the RPC service is being called. For instance, an
archive service, that gives the historical values of channels, may
advertise itself as being on a single channel called say "archive
service" (so the NTURI path field in that case would be set to
"archiveservice", and in that case, the name of the EPICS channel about
which archive data is wanted might well be encoded into one of the
NTURI's query field parameters. Alternatively, the archive service might
advertise a number of channels, each named perhaps after the channels
whose historical data is being requested. For instance, a path may be
"quad45:bdes;history", if that was the name of one of the channels
offered by the archive service. An example of this second form is given
below.

Use of NTURI may be explained by example. The following is an example
client side of Channel RPC exchange, where a notional archive service,
is asked for the data for a PV between two points in time. In this
example, the archive service is advertising the channel name
"quad45:bdes;history". Presumably, that service knows the archive
history of a (second) channel, named probably, "quad45:bdes".

Construct the introspection interface (i.e. type definition) of the
NTURI conformant structure that will be used to make requests to the
archive service.

::

   // Construct an NTURI for making a request to a service that understands
   // query arguments named "starttime" and "endtime".
   FieldCreate fieldCreate = FieldFactory.getFieldCreate();
   Structure queryStructure = fieldCreate.createStructure(
       new String[] {"starttime", "endtime"},
       new Field[] { fieldCreate.createScalar(ScalarType.pvString),
                     fieldCreate.createScalar(ScalarType.pvString)});
   Structure uriStructure =
       fieldCreate.createStructure("epics:nt/NTURI:1.0",
            new String[] { "path", "query" },
            new Field[] { fieldCreate.createScalar(ScalarType.pvString),
                          queryStructure } );

Populate our uriStructure (conformant to NTURI) with a specific request.

::

   // Get a EasyPVA singleton.
   EasyPVA easyPVA = EasyPVAFactory.get();

   // Construct an NTURI with which to ask for the archive data of quad45:bdes
   PVStructure request = PVDataFactory.getPVDataCreate().
           createPVStructure(uriStructure);
   request.getStringField("path").put("quad45:bdes;history");
   PVStructure query = request.getStructureField("query");
   query.getStringField("starttime").put("2011-09-16T02.12.55");
   query.getStringField("endtime").put("2011-09-16T10.01.03");

   // Ask for the data, using the NTURI
   PVStructure result = easyPVA.createChannel(request.getStringField("path").get()).createRPC().request(request);
   if ( result != null )
       System.out.println("The URI request structure:\n" + request
                   +"\n\nResulted in:\n" + result);

The server side is not illustrated, but clearly its code would have
registered a number of ChannelRPC services, each named after the PV
whose historical data it offered.

NTNameValue
~~~~~~~~~~~

NTNameValue is the EPICS V4 Normative Type that describes a system of
name and scalar values.

Use cases: In a school, a single NTNamedValue might describe the grades
from a number of classes for one student.

::

   NTNameValue :=

   structure
       string[]     name
       scalar_t[]   value
       string       descriptor   :opt
       alarm_t      alarm        :opt
       time_t       timeStamp    :opt

where:

name
   The keys associated with the
   ’value\ ``field. Each element of``\ name\ ``identifies the same indexed element of the``\ value\`
   field, using a string label.
value
   The data values, each element of which is associated with the
   correspondingly indexed element of the ``name`` field.

Each name (or "key") in the array of names, MUST be interpreted as being
associated with its same indexed element of the ``value`` array.

.. _nt-table:

NTTable
~~~~~~~

NTTable is the EPICS V4 Normative Type suitable for column-oriented
tabular datasets.

An NTTable is made up of a number of arrays. Each array can be thought
of as a column. Each array MUST be of a scalar type and all the arrays
MUST be of the same length. Each array may be of a different scalar
type. The set of the *i*\ th array members of all the columns make up
one row, or n-tuple. The number of elements of ``labels`` MUST be equal
to the number of fields of ``value``.

Use case examples: a table of the Twiss parameters of all the lattice
elements in an accelerator section. Another example, where the columns
might vary call-to-call to an RPC setting, would be that of an EPICS V4
SQL database service. In that example one NTTable returned by the
service would contain the tabular results of a SQL SELECT, essentially a
recoded JDBC or ODBC ResultSet - see the
`rdbservice <#bib:rdbservice>`__.

::

   NTTable :=

   structure
       string[]   labels              // Very short text describing each field below, i.e. column labels
       structure  value
           {scalar_t[]  colname}0+ // 0 or more scalar array instances, the column values.
       string     descriptor  : opt
       alarm_t    alarm       : opt
       time_t     timeStamp   : opt

where:

labels
   The table column headings are given by the ``labels`` field. Each
   column heading given as one element of the array of strings.
value
   The data of the table are encoded in a structure named ``value``. The
   columnar data field is named "value" (rather than, for instance,
   "columndata") so that the primary field of the type is named the same
   for all Normative Types. That helps general purpose clients identify
   the primary field of any Normative Type instance.

Interpretation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An NTTable instance represents a table of data. The column data is given
in scalar arrays in the structure field ``value``, and the column
headings are given in field ``labels``. Each / scalar array field of
``value`` contains the data for the column corresponding to the same
indexed element of the ``labels`` field. Agents SHOULD use the elements
of ``labels`` as the column headings. *There is no normative requirement
that the field names of ``value`` match the strings in ``labels``*.

Note that the above description is given in terms of a table and its
columns, but there is nothing specifically columnar about how this data
may be rendered. A user may choose to print the fields row wise if, for
instance, if there are many fields in ``value``, but each has only
length 1 or 2. For example, if one wanted to give all the scalar data
related to one device, then one might use an NTTable rendered in such a
way.

Validation
^^^^^^^^^^

The number of *scalar_t[]* fields in the value structure, and the length
of ``labels`` MUST be the same. All *scalar_t[]* fields in the ``value``
structure MUST have the same length, which is the number of "rows" in
the table.

NTAttribute
~~~~~~~~~~~

NTAttribute is the EPICS V4 Normative Type for a named attribute of any
type. It is is essentially a key-value pair which optionally can be
tagged with additional strings.

This allows, for example, a collection of attributes to be queried on
the basis of attribute name or tags.

::

   NTAttribute :=

   structure
       string    name
       any       value
       string[]  tags          : opt
       string    descriptor    : opt
       alarm_t   alarm         : opt
       time_t    timeStamp     : opt

where:

name
   The name of the attribute. The "key" of the key-value pair.
value
   The value of the attribute. The "value" of a key-value pair.
tags
   Additional tags that an attribute can carry.

Specific Normative Types
------------------------

The "Specific Normative Types" below are types oriented towards
application-level scientific and engineering use cases. Compare to
`General Normative Types <#general-normative-types>`__ defined above.
The currently defined types are each described in a section below.

Unless otherwise stated:

-  Times MUST be in seconds
-  Frequencies MUST be in Hz.

NTMultiChannel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NTMultiChannel is an EPICS V4 Normative Type that aggregates an array of
values from different EPICS Process Variable (PV) channel sources, not
necessarily of the same type, into a single variable.

::

   NTMultiChannel :=

   structure
       anyunion_t[]  value              // The channel values
       string[]      channelName        // The channel names
       string        descriptor         :opt
       alarm_t       alarm              :opt
       time_t        timeStamp          :opt
       int[]         severity           :opt
       int[]         status             :opt
       string[]      message            :opt
       long[]        secondsPastEpoch   :opt
       int[]         nanoseconds        :opt
       int[]         userTag            :opt

where:

value
   The value from each channel.
channelName
   The name of each channel.
alarm
   The alarm associated with the NTMultiChannel itself. ``severity``,
   ``status``, and ``message`` show the alarm for each channel.
timeStamp
   The timestamp associated with the NTMultiChannel itself.
   ``secondsPastEpoch``, ``nanoseconds`` and ``userTag`` show the
   timestamp for each channel.
severity
   The alarm severity associated with each channel.
status
   The alarm status associated with each channel.
message
   The alarm message associated with each channel.
secondsPastEpoch
   The ``secondsPastEpoch`` field of the timestamp associated with each
   channel.
nanoseconds
   The ``nanoseconds`` field of the timestamp associated with each
   channel.
userTag
   The ``userTag`` field of the timestamp associated with each channel.

NTNDArray
~~~~~~~~~

NTNDArray is an EPICS Version 4 Normative Type designed to encode data
from detectors and cameras, especially
`areaDetector <http://cars9.uchicago.edu/software/epics/areaDetector.html>`__
applications. The type is heavily modeled on areaDetector's
`NDArray <http://cars9.uchicago.edu/software/epics/areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/class_n_d_array.html>`__
class. One NTNDArray gives one frame.

The definition of NTNDArray in full is:

::

   NTNDArray :=

   structure
       value_t       value
       codec_t       codec
       long          compressedSize
       long          uncompressedSize
       dimension_t[] dimension
       int           uniqueId
       time_t        dataTimeStamp
       NTAttribute[] attribute
       string        descriptor  :opt
       alarm_t       alarm       :opt
       time_t        timeStamp   :opt
       display_t     display     :opt

The meaning of the above fields, the definition of *value_t* and of
*dimension_t* and the additional requirements for NDAttribute are
described below. To simplify this the NTNDArray can be regarded as being
composed of the following parts:

::

   NTNDArray :=

   structure
       Image data and codec
       Data sizes
       Dimensions
       Unique ID and data timestamp
       Attributes
       Optional fields

Each of these will be discussed separately.

Image data and codec
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *Image data and codec* parts of an NTNDArray are composed of the
following fields:

::

       value_t value // Image data
       codec_t codec // Codec

where:

value
   An array which encodes an N-dimensional array containing the data for
   the image itself.
codec
   Information on the how the data in value encodes the N-dimensional
   array.

A *value_t* is implemented as a pvData Field of type
`"union" <http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/docbuild/pvDataJava/tip/documentation/pvDataJava.html#metalang_union>`__
with the following form:

::

   value_t:=

   union
       boolean[] booleanValue
       byte[]    byteValue
       short[]   shortValue
       int[]     intValue
       long[]    longValue
       ubyte[]   ubyteValue
       ushort[]  ushortValue
       uint[]    uintValue
       ulong[]   ulongValue
       float[]   floatValue
       double[]  doubleValue

A *codec_t* is implemented as a pvData Field of type
`"structure" <http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/docbuild/pvDataJava/tip/documentation/pvDataJava.html#metalang_structure>`__
of type ID "codec_t" with the following form:

::

   codec_t :=

   structure
       string name
       any    parameters

where:

name
   The encoding scheme, e.g. the codec in the case of compressed data.
parameters
   Any additional information required to interpret the data.

The ``value`` field stores a scalar array of one of the scalar types
permitted by the definition of ``value`` above whose value MUST
represent an N-dimensional scalar array of one of the permitted scalar
types whose dimensions are given by the ``dimension`` field (see below).
Note that the scalar type of the array stored in ``value`` MAY be
different from that of the array it represents.

The ``codec`` field is a structure which describes how the N-dimensional
scalar array is represented by the value of the scalar array stored in
the ``value`` field.

The ``name`` field of the ``codec`` field (``codec.name``) is a string
which identifies the scheme by which the data in ``value`` is encoded,
such as an algorithm used to compress the data. If it is not the empty
string, the value of the ``codec.name`` field SHOULD be namespace
qualified.

The ``parameters`` field of the ``codec`` field (``codec.parameters``)
is a field which contains any additional information required to
interpret the data in ``value``. The format and meaning of
``codec.parameters`` is ``codec.name``-dependent.

When the value of the ``codec.name`` field is the empty string the data
in ``value`` MUST represent an N-dimensional array of the same scalar
type as the scalar array stored in ``value`` whose dimensions are given
by the ``dimension`` field. The elements of the array stored in
``value`` MUST be the elements of the N-dimensional array laid out in
row major order. In this case the length of the ``value`` array SHOULD
equal the product of the dimensions and MUST be greater than or equal to
it.

When the ``codec.name`` field value is not the empty string the
interpretation of the data in the ``value`` field is dependent on the
``codec`` field. Any requirements on the type or length of the array
stored in the ``value`` field are ``codec``-dependent.

Any endianness information associated with a compression algorithm or
other encoding SHOULD be encoded via the ``codec`` field, either through
the ``codec.name`` or ``codec.parameters`` fields.

Similarly any information required to determine the scalar type of the
N-dimensional array when the value of ``codec.name`` field is non-empty
SHOULD also be encoded in the ``codec`` field.

Except for the above requirements, the meaning of the ``codec`` field,
beyond the case of the empty ``codec.name`` string, is not currently
specified.

Data sizes
^^^^^^^^^^

The *Data sizes]* part of an NTNDArray is composed of the following
fields:

::

       long compressedSize
       long uncompressedSize

where:

compressedSize
   The size of the data in bytes after any compression or other
   encoding.
uncompressedSize
   The size of the data in bytes before any compression or other
   encoding.

The value of the ``compressedSize`` field MUST be equal to the product
of the length of the scalar array field stored in the ``value`` field
and the size of the scalar type in bytes (i.e. 1, 2, 4 or 8 for signed
or unsigned byte, short, int or long respectively, 1 for boolean, 4 for
float and 8 for double).

The value of the ``uncompressedSize`` field MUST be equal to the product
of the value of the ``size`` field of each element in the structure
array ``dimension`` field (described below) and the size in bytes of the
scalar type of the scalar array represented by ``value``. If the number
of elements of the ``dimension`` field is 0 the value of the
``uncompressedSize`` MUST be 0.

Dimensions
^^^^^^^^^^

The *Dimensions* part of an NTNDArray is composed of the ``dimension``
field

::

       dimension_t[] dimension

A *dimension_t* is implemented as a pvData Field of type
`"structure" <http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/docbuild/pvDataJava/tip/documentation/pvDataJava.html#metalang_structure>`__
of type ID "dimension_t" with the following form:

::

   dimension_t :=

   structure
       int     size
       int     offset
       int     fullSize
       int     binning
       boolean reverse

where:

size
   The number of elements in this dimension of the array.
offset
   The offset in this dimension relative to the origin of the original
   data source.
fullSize
   The number of elements in this dimension of the the original data
   source.
binning
   The binning (pixel summation, 1=no binning) in this dimension
   relative to original data source source.
reverse
   The orientation (false=normal, true=reversed) in this dimension
   relative to the original data source source.

The number of elements in the value of the ``dimension`` field MAY be 0.
A client SHOULD check for this case and take appropriate action.

If an NTNDArray represents a subregion of a larger region of interest of
an original image, its ``offset``, ``binning`` and ``reverse``\ field
values SHOULD be relative to the original image and its ``fullSize``
field value SHOULD be the size of the original.

*dimension_t* is analogous to
`NDDimension_t <http://cars9.uchicago.edu/software/epics/areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/struct_n_d_dimension.html>`__
in areaDetector.

Unique ID and data timestamp
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *Unique ID and data timestamp* parts of an NTNDArray are composed of
the following fields:

::

       int     uniqueId
       time_t  dataTimeStamp

where:

uniqueId
   A number that SHOULD be unique for all NTNDArrays produced by a
   source after it has started.
dataTimeStamp
   Timestamp of the data.

The value of ``dataTimeStamp`` MAY be different from that of the
(optional) ``timeStamp`` field below.

The ``uniqueId`` and ``dataTimeStamp`` fields of NTNDArray correspond to
the uniqueId and timeStamp fields respectively of an NDArray.

NTNDArray attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *Attributes* part of an NTNDArray is composed of the field:

::

       NTAttribute[] attribute

where *NTAttribute* is as defined by this standard, but is extended in
this case as follows:

::

   NTAttribute :=

   structure
       string    name
       any       value
       string[]  tags          : opt
       string    descriptor
       alarm_t   alarm         : opt
       time_t    timeStamp     : opt
       int       sourceType
       string    source

where:

sourceType
   The origin of the attribute

   ::

      NDAttrSourceDriver   = 0,   /** Attribute is obtained directly from driver */
      NDAttrSourceParam    = 1,   /** Attribute is obtained from an asyn parameter library */
      NDAttrSourceEPICSPV  = 2,   /** Attribute is obtained from an EPICS PV */
      NDAttrSourceFunct    = 3    /** Attribute is obtained from a user-specified function  */

source
   The source string of this attribute.

Note that the optional descriptor field of *NTAttribute* is mandatory
for attributes of an NTNDArray.

*NTAttribute* here is extended by the addition of the ``sourceType`` and
``source`` fields. ``source`` is a string which gives the origin of the
attribute according to the value of the integer ``sourceType`` field as
follows:

-  For a ``sourceType`` of value ``NDAttrSourceDriver`` the ``source``
   string SHOULD be the empty string.
-  For a ``sourceType`` of value ``NDAttrSourceParam`` the ``source``
   string SHOULD be the name of the
   `asyn <http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/modules/soft/asyn/>`__ parameter
   from which the attribute value was obtained.
-  For a ``sourceType`` of value ``NDAttrSourceEPICSPV`` the ``source``
   string SHOULD be the name of the EPICS PV from which the attribute
   value was obtained.
-  For a ``sourceType`` of value ``NDAttrSourceFunct`` the ``source``
   string SHOULD be the name of the user function from which the
   attribute value was obtained.

The extension of *NTAttribute* is analogous to
`NDAttribute <http://cars9.uchicago.edu/software/epics/areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/class_n_d_attribute.html>`__
in areaDetector. The ``name``, ``descriptor``, ``sourceType`` and
``source`` fields correspond to the pName, pDescription, sourceType,
pSource members of an NDAttribute respectively.

The attributes themselves are not defined by this standard.

For areaDetector applications the ``attribute`` field encodes the linked
list of NDAttributes in an NDArray.

[Note: areaDetector currently defines two integer attributes, colorMode
and bayerPattern, with descriptions "Color mode" and "Bayer pattern"
respectively:

colorMode
   An attribute that describes how an N-d array is to be interpreted as
   an image, taking one of the values in this enumeration:

   ::

      NDColorModeMono   = 0,    /** Monochromatic image */
      NDColorModeBayer  = 1,    /** Bayer pattern image,
                                    1 value per pixel but with color filter on detector */
      NDColorModeRGB1   = 2,    /** RGB image with pixel color interleave,
                                    data array is [3, NX, NY] */
      NDColorModeRGB2   = 3,    /** RGB image with row color interleave,
                                    data array is [NX, 3, NY]  */
      NDColorModeRGB3   = 4,    /** RGB image with plane color interleave,
                                    data array is [NX, NY, 3]  */
      NDColorModeYUV444 = 5,    /** YUV image, 3 bytes encodes 1 RGB pixel */
      NDColorModeYUV422 = 6,    /** YUV image, 4 bytes encodes 2 RGB pixel */
      NDColorModeYUV411 = 7     /** YUV image, 6 bytes encodes 4 RGB pixels */

bayerPattern
   An attribute valid when colorMode is NDColorModeBayer providing
   additional information required for the interpretation of an N-d
   array as an image in this case, taking one of the values in this
   enumeration:

   ::

      NDBayerRGGB       = 0,    /** First line RGRG, second line GBGB... */
      NDBayerGBRG       = 1,    /** First line GBGB, second line RGRG... */
      NDBayerGRBG       = 2,    /** First line GRGR, second line BGBG... */
      NDBayerBGGR       = 3     /** First line BGBG, second line GRGR... */

Other areaDetector attributes are user-defined.]

NTContinuum
~~~~~~~~~~~

NTContinuum is the EPICS V4 Normative Type used to express a sequence of
point values in time or frequency domain. Each point has N values (N>=1)
and an additional value which describes the index of the list. The
additional value is carried in the ``base`` field. The ``value`` field
carries the values which make up the point in index order.

An additional ``units`` field gives a units string for the N values and
the additional value.

::

   NTContinuum :=

   structure
       double[]   base
       double[]   value
       string[]   units
       string     descriptor    :opt
       alarm_t    alarm         :opt
       time_t     timeStamp     :opt

The number of values in a point must be derived as:

Nvals = len(value)/len(base)

And the following invariant must be preserved:

len(units)-1 == Nvals

For points (A\ :sub:`i`, B\ :sub:`i`, C\ :sub:`i`) for indices i = 1, 2, 3
the ``value`` array is:

[A\ :sub:`1`, B\ :sub:`1`, C\ :sub:`1`, A\ :sub:`2`, B\ :sub:`2`,
C\ :sub:`2`, A\ :sub:`3`, B\ :sub:`3`, C\ :sub:`3`]

NTHistogram
~~~~~~~~~~~

NTHistogram is the EPICS V4 Normative Type used to encode the data and
representation of a (1 dimensional) histogram. Specifically, it
encapsulates frequency binned data.

For 2d histograms (i.e. both x and y observations are binned) and
n-tuple data (e.g. land masses of different listed countries) see
NTMatrix or NTTable.

::

   NTHistogram :=

   structure
       double[]   ranges                     // The start and end points of each bin
       (short[] | int[] | long[])  value     // The frequency count, or otherwise value, of each bin
       string     descriptor    :opt
       alarm_t    alarm         :opt
       time_t     timeStamp     :opt

.. _interpretation-1:

Interpretation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One NTHistogram gives the information required to convey a histogram
representation of some underlying observations. It does not convey the
values of each of the observations themselves.

The number of bins is given by the length of the ``value`` array.
``ranges`` indicates the low value and high value of each bin. The range
for *bin(i)* is given by *ranges(i)* to *ranges(i+1)*. Specifically,
since we want end points of both the first bin and last bin included,
all bin intervals except the last one, MUST be *right half open*; from
that bin's low value *ranges(i)* (included) to that bin's high value
*ranges(i+1)* (excluded). The last bin MUST be fully *open* (low and
high value included).

A log plot histogram (in which the independent variable x is binned on a
log scale), would be communicated using a range array of decades
(1.0E01, 1.0E02, 1.0E03 etc).

.. _validation-1:

Validation
^^^^^^^^^^

The array length of ``ranges`` MUST be the array length of ``value`` +
1.

NTAggregate
~~~~~~~~~~~

NTAggregate is the EPICS V4 Normative Type to compactly convey data
which combines several measurements or observation. NTAggregate gives
simple summary statistic `bib:agg <#bib:agg>`__ about the central
tendency and dispersion of a set of data points.

Use cases: for instance, an NTAggregate could be used to summarize the
value of one beam position offset reading over some number of pulses
(N). It also includes the time range of the sampled points, so it could
be used for time domain rebasing. For instance, an FPGA sending data at
10KHz, and you want to display its output, but you don't want to display
at the native rate. Also, it could be used for transmitting or storing
compressed archive data.

NTAggregate doesn't cover the shape of a distribution so it only
reasonably helps you do symmetrical distributions (no skewness or
kurtosis), and it doesn't include any help for indicating the extent of
dependency on another variable (correlation).

::

   NTAggregate :=

   structure
       double     value                 // The center point of the observations,
                                        // nominally the mean.
       long       N                     // Number of observations
       double     dispersion      :opt  // Dispersion of observations;
                                         // nominally the Standard Deviation or RMS
       double     first           :opt  // Initial observation value
       time_t     firstTimeStamp  :opt  // Time of initial observation
       double     last            :opt  // Final observation value
       time_t     lastTimeStamp   :opt  // Time of final observation
       double     max             :opt  // Highest value in the N observations
       double     min             :opt  // Lowest value in the N observations
       string     descriptor      :opt
       alarm_t    alarm           :opt
       time_t     timeStamp       :opt

where:

value
   The summary statistic of the set of observations conveyed by this
   NTAggregate. For instance their arithmetic mean.
N
   The number of observations summarized by this NTAggregate.
dispersion
   The extent to which the observations are centered around the
   ``value``. For instance, if the ``value`` contains a mean, then the
   dispersion may be the variance or the standard deviation. The
   ``descriptor`` should indicate which.
first
   The value of the temporally first observation conveyed by this
   NTAggregate.
firstTimeStamp
   The time of observation of the temporally first observation conveyed
   by this NTAggregate.
last
   The value of the temporally final observation conveyed by this
   NTAggregate.
lastTimeStamp
   The time of observation of the temporally final observation conveyed
   by this NTAggregate.
max
   The numerically largest value in the set of observations conveyed by
   this NTAggregate.
min
   The numerically smallest value in the set of observations conveyed by
   this NTAggregate.

.. _interpretation-2:

Interpretation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One NTAggregate instance describes some number (given by N) of
observations. If firstTimeStamp and lastTimeStamp are given, then the N
observations MUST have been taken over the period of time specified. If
first, last, max or min are given, they MUST refer to the actual values
of the N observations being summarized.

The ``value`` field value computed by server agents may be the
arithmetic mean of the observation data being summarized by this
NTAggregate, but NTAggregate does not normatively define that. Other
measures of mean (geometric, harmonic) may be assigned. Indeed other
measures of central tendency may be used. The interpretation to give an
instance of an NTAggregate SHOULD be conveyed in the ``descriptor``.

Where dispersion is a measure of the standard deviation, which estimator
of the standard deviation [1/N or 1/(N-1)] was used, is also not defined
normatively.

Appendix A: Possible Future Additions to this Specification
-----------------------------------------------------------

NTUnion
~~~~~~~

*NTUnion* would be a Normative Type for interoperation of essentially
any data structure, plus description, alarm and timestamp fields.

::

   NTUnion :=

   structure
       anyunion_t   value
       string       descriptor       :opt
       alarm_t      alarm            :opt
       time_t       timeStamp        :opt

NTScalarMultiChannel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NTScalarMultiChannel is an EPICS V4 Normative Type that aggregates an
array of values from different EPICS Process Variable (PV) channel
sources of the same scalar type into a single variable.

Use cases: In a particle accelerator, a single NTScalarMultiChannel
might include the data of a number of Beam Position Monitors' X offset
values, or of a number of quadrupoles' desired field values.

::

   NTScalarMultiChannel :=

   structure
       scalar_t[]    value              // The channel values
       string[]      channelName        // The channel names
       string        descriptor         :opt
       alarm_t       alarm              :opt
       time_t        timeStamp          :opt
       int[]         severity           :opt
       int[]         status             :opt
       string[]      message            :opt
       long[]        secondsPastEpoch   :opt
       int[]         nanoseconds        :opt
       int[]         userTag            :opt

where:

value
   The value from each channel.
channelName
   The name of each channel.
alarm
   The alarm associated with the NTScalarMultiChannel itself.
   ``severity``, ``status``, and ``message`` show the alarm for each
   channel.
timeStamp
   The timestamp associated with the NTScalarMultiChannel itself.
   ``secondsPastEpoch``, ``nanoseconds`` and ``userTag`` show the
   timestamp for each channel.
severity
   The alarm severity associated with each channel.
status
   The alarm status associated with each channel.
message
   The alarm message associated with each channel.
secondsPastEpoch
   The ``secondsPastEpoch`` field of the timestamp associated with each
   channel.
nanoseconds
   The ``nanoseconds`` field of the timestamp associated with each
   channel.
userTag
   The ``userTag`` field of the timestamp associated with each channel.

Appendix B: Normative Type Identifiers
--------------------------------------

This Appendix describes the Normative Type Identifiers of the abstract
data types defined by this document. These are the strings which
identify the type carried by a structure. In the pvAccess binding (which
is at present the only one implemented for EPICS V4), the type ID of the
structure MUST carry one of these identifier strings. In doing so, the
structure instance declares itself to conform to the corresponding
definition carried in this specification document.

The syntax of the Normative Type identifier is:

::

       namespacename/typename:versionnumber

The Normative Type Identifier "Namespace Name" part, is:

::

       epics:nt

The Normative Type Identifier "Type Name" and version number parts
corresponding to `this draft <#thisversion>`__ of the Normative Types
Document (this document), MUST be valued as following:

.. table:: Type Names that may be used in the Type Name part of a Normative Type Identifier of an EPICS V4 Normative Type in the namespace of this draft of the Normative Types specification

   ============== ======= =============== ============================================================================================================================
   Type Name      Version Depends on      Short Description

   NTNameValue    1.0     (none)          An array of scalar values where each element is named.
   NTTable        1.0     (none)          A table of scalars, where each column may be of different scalar array type
   NTAttribute    1.0     (none)          A key-value pair, with optional string tags, where the value is of any type.
   NTMultiChannel 1.0     (none)          An array of PV names, their values, and metadata.
   NTNDArray      1.0     NTAttribute 1.0 A pixel and metadata type, designed to encode a frame of data from detectors and cameras.
   NTContinuum    1.0     (none)          Expresses a sequence of data points in time or frequency domain.
   NTHistogram    1.0     (none)          An array of real number intervals, and their frequency counts. Expresses a 1D histogram.
   NTAggregate    1.0     (none)          A mean value, standard deviation, and other metadata. Expresses the central tendency and dispersion of a set of data points.
   ============== ======= =============== ============================================================================================================================

For example, the type ID of a structure describing an NTScalar, must be
valued "epics:nt/NTScalar:1.0". The type ID of a structure describing an
NTNDArray, must be valued "epics:nt/NTNDArray:1.0".

Following drafts of this document MAY well correspond to the same
Namespace Name and Type Names as used in this draft. Also note that the
same namespace may well be used for a different collection of types or
Type Names, as this document matures.
